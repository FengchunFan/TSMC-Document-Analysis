(NYSE:TSM) is expected to win up to $5 billion in grants from the U.S. government for building a chip fabrication facility in Arizona.\\nBloomberg reported on Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the world's largest contract chipmaker would soon be announcing the deal, although it wasn't clear whether the award would come from the $52 billion CHIPS Act fund for boosting U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.\\nIn May 2020, TSMC announced plans to invest $12 billion in a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to bolster its production capacity in the United States. Then in December the same year, plans for a second fab \\u2014 again, in Phoenix \\u2014 were announced, taking the total investment to $40 billion.\\nThe company said at the time: \\\"As one of TSMC's advanced fabs, TSMC Arizona will play a vital role in the U.S. government's goal to onshore semiconductor manufacturing and strengthen national economic competitiveness.\\\"\\nConstruction of the first fab began in April 2021 and volume production is expected to begin in the first half of 2025. The second fab is expected to be operational two or three years later.\\nThe company already operates a U.S. fab in the State of Washington.\\nAlso Read: GlobalFoundries To Scoop $1.5 Billion In CHIPS Act Grants: What It Means For Semiconductor Sector\\nTSMC's Main Customers Nearby\\nTSMC's largest customer is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which it calls \\\"Customer A\\\" on its Securities and Exchange Commission filings, accounted for 25%, or $17.5 billion, of the chipmaker's annual revenue in 2023, according to financial analyst and tech writer Dan Nystedt.\\nAlthough the company doesn't disclose its business dealings and customer details, it is widely believed that the company designated as \\\"Customer B\\\" in last year's filing is Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which was responsible for 11%, or $7.73 billion of TSMC's net annual revenue.\\nAmong its other customers are Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), all of which, along with both Apple and Nvidia, are based in California, making TSMC's Phoenix location rather handy.\\nFurther details of TSMC's federal grant and other awards under the CHIPS Act are expected to be announced over the coming days and weeks as President Joe Biden looks to cement the program as he ramps up his re-election campaign.\\nThe only official announcement of a CHIPS Act grant so far, has been GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), which was awarded $1.5 billion to expand production facilities at its plant in Malta, New York and its Vermont facility.\\nThe Act was launched in 2022 to boost domestic production of semiconductors after crippling supply chain issues in the industry caused massive production delays for several industries.\\nNow Read: Biden's State Of The Union May Coincide With Government Shutdown: What To Expect, Sectors To Watch\\nPhoto: Shutterstock\",\n          \"#(1)\\nThis Week's News\\nYahoo Finance -

Due to the cyclicality nature of the industry, risk of commodity price (oil) exposure significantly impacts the airlines' performance outcomes.\\nIn this study, the traditional literature that underpins airline fuel hedging within a global setting is re-visited. The results from the existing literature are considered when conceptualizing a model that describes the impact of fuel hedging on a carriers's firm value using two measures, i.e. stock prices and Tobin's Q. Aside from the primary effects of fuel price hedging the study considers tertiary effects emitted by the origin and type of carrier. Combining these three aspects into a comprehensive study, contrasting legacy and low-costs at the same time as European and US carriers, over a horizon of nine years provides to the existing literature.\\nThe results of the study strengthen previous studies that report a limited impact of fuel hedging endeavors on operators' firm performance, ceteris paribus. These effects are slightly mitigated by the origin and the type of operator (legacy vs. low-cost) as well as tertiary control variables. As a consequence for practitioners, hedging may be seen as a tool of risk mitigation but not as a tool to strengthen an airlines firm value.\\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001430\\nThe Industry\\nGlobal Aviation Outlook 2022\\nDelayed But Persuasive Recovery Despite New Turbulence\\nTravel will rebound strongly in 2022. Consumers are eager to travel and short-haul continental traffic will benefit from pent-up leisure demand. The closure of airspaces is a new blow for aviation and Covid is a headwind for China meaning the return to profitability may be pushed back, though the recovery is expected to continue\\nRecovery in aviation shifts to second stage in 2022, despite lasting volatility\\nThe pandemic has hampered the airline industry for much longer than expected. After the recovery began in 2021, new waves of the virus and fresh travel restrictions prevented the sector from scaling up. This year, however, is meant to be the year of delayed but sustained recovery, despite new scars. Global passenger traffic (RPK) recovered to 50% of pre-pandemic levels in the first months of 2022, but intercontinental traffic still has a long way to go.\\nStrong rebound in leisure travel expected for the summer of 2022\\nWhat we learned from 2021 is that when restrictions are lifted, demand for travel is still there, particularly for family visits and holidays. Many air passengers have suspended trips over the last two years leading to pent-up demand. This could also lead to 'front loading' this summer as consumers may consider these travel freedoms to be temporary. This suggests the recovery could lose strength later on.\\nPassenger traffic showed a significant increase, up two thirds of pre-pandemic levels in March in Europe's main airports. Airlines such as Ryanair have reported stronger international bookings - especially for short-haul international flights despite uncertainty from the war in Ukraine and higher ticket fares. Sales data on international tickets also point in this direction. Following a weak 2021 - especially in Europe - airports also expect a much better 2022.\\nFlights still less busy than before, leading to inefficiency\\nFlights have returned stronger than passenger numbers (possibly also to retain slot rights). Average global passenger load factors are still hovering around 70%, which shows that occupancy rates of aircraft are still lower than the pre-pandemic levels of >80%. This means that the cost-efficiency of airlines is still suboptimal which weighs on cost-income ratios. How load factors evolve is therefore something to watch as well in 2022.\\nStaff shortages challenge airlines in returning capacity to the market\\nParadoxically, hiring staff is now a critical factor in getting aircraft frequency back online, as airlines cut their workforces over the pandemic and cabin crew staff left for other sectors. Sick leave rates are also higher than before, which is leading to operational challenges. For every restored flight additional personnel and job markets are tight. This may limit expansion, frequencies and routes, especially in the US (e.g. Jetblue).\\nWar in Ukraine affects European airline traffic, as well as airfreight capacity\\nThe mutual closing of air spaces has led to a reduction of passenger traffic to and from Russia and Ukraine. Russia accounts for 4.5% of global revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), and because of the sanctions this will undoubtedly go down as Russian holidays to European countries will fall (Russian travelling accounted for 5.7% of European traffic in 2021). Domestic travel will also suffer.   \\nThe massive size of the Russian airspace avoidance affects some 10% of total passenger kilometres, according to IATA. Avoiding Russian airspace leads to detours and longer flights on East-West routes (e.g. from London, Amsterdam or Frankfurt to Tokyo, Seoul or Beijing). This will make trips less efficient and pushes up fuel costs even more, leading to higher ticket prices and extra capacity deployment.   \\nThe war in Ukraine also leads to direct new capacity cuts. The grounding of Russian carriers like Airbridge cargo (approx. 20 freighters) due to the closing of airspaces and disturbed supply of spare parts for freighters reduces capacity. Lufthansa expects global air cargo capacity to consequently be reduced by 10%, and global airfreight forwarder Kuhne Nagel indicated its capacity was down 30% on the Far-East Europe route following the sanctions. Due to scarce capacity, airlines are also considering re-allocating capacity to (possibly more profitable) other routes.   \\nIn total, hundreds of aircraft leased to Russian operators were still in Russian territory at the end of March, but they are not in service on the usual international routes anymore. It's uncertain how many eventually will be returned to the lessors, but this will also curtail global capacity.   \\nFull global recovery in passenger aviation not expected before 2024\\nAlthough we expect the recovery in aviation to continue this year, global passenger volume is not expected to recover in full before 2024. The war in Ukraine will temper the pace of recovery in 2022. In addition, a setback in the large Chinese airline market due to new Covid-related restrictions is slowing the return of travel volumes as well. Without these events, the recovery would undeniably have been stronger this year. For airlines based in the US, the impact will most likely be less severe than for European airlines, and the impact for low-cost carriers will also be less than for traditional intercontinental operating carriers. Despite the long haul to recovery, global passenger figures are still expected to eventually return to an annual growth trend of 3% or 4%.\\nContinued large regional differences in recovery - US in the front\\nOn the back of a large home market, airlines in the US performed better than European airlines over the last year. Mid-April 2022 passenger checks at US airports are back to around 90% of pre-pandemic levels and bookings appeared to be relatively strong. European flight numbers returned to 80%, but passenger load factors in Europe are still below the 70-80% US figures.\\nA relevant difference is that the American (highspeed) rail network is less intensively developed than the European system and distances are longer, so there are fewer alternatives while airline interconnectedness is high. In Europe though, rail network connections are being extended and governments, like the French, aim to shift short-haul flights to rail on short notice.\\nChinese airline market struggles with return of Covid restrictions\\nContrary to the US, the Chinese airline market has slumped after new Covid-related lockdowns. After an almost full return to pre-pandemic levels early in 2021, domestic airline travel figures started to decline again and were around 60% in early 2022. The risk of new measures has led to uncertainty about when the recovery might pick up again.\\nThe other major Asian growth market, India, is also seeing a strong trend of returning domestic airline traffic, which can also be seen in India's public transport. With a growing middle class, India could be a driving force behind the global recovery in the years to come.\\nAdapting to the post-pandemic world - fewer business seats, more freighters\\nThe dynamics of the post-pandemic world make it relevant for airlines to review their business models and strategy. Air networks may emerge smaller than previously expected and volumes could remain more volatile. With fewer business passengers, smaller aircraft may gain popularity. This will further benefit single-aisle aircraft, which are more flexible and easier to fill. Some airlines may consider changing their seat composition to include fewer business seats and more upgraded economy class seats ('economy plus').\\nIn today's world, freighters are also becoming more structurally important. Freight cushioned the drop in results for intercontinental carriers and due to high rates, it even counted long-haul international passenger routes will take the longest to recover and these are important for belly freight.\\nHigher fuel costs, but this won't slash traffic in 2022\\nThe gradual rise in oil prices in the second half of 2021 and the spike following the war in Ukraine significantly pushed up airline operational costs. Over the fourth quarter of 2021, jet fuel costs already accounted for 24% of airlines' total operating expenses and this will go up further. Even if oil prices ease in the remainder of 2022, results will be hit and this complicates the return to profitability for many airlines this year.\\nTo what extent airlines are affected depends on fuel hedging strategies. In general, low-cost carriers apply hedging rates more than traditional carriers, which implies that the impact for 2022 will be mitigated. Traditional carriers usually accept more risk on the fuel side, with lower hedging rates. This means higher kerosine prices tend to affect them more.\\nAnd there is also a difference between European and American airlines as the latter tend to bear the risk themselves (Southwest airlines using hedges is an exception).\\nAirlines like Air France, KLM and Delta have started to raise ticket fares with fuel surcharges. A positive note is that travellers seem willing to pay extra for their tickets at this point (with oil prices just above $100). Nevertheless, high fuel prices make fuel efficiency even more important.\\nAir cargo business keeps outperforming in 2022\\nOne thing the pandemic made clear is the need for flexibility and a fast alternative in case of unexpected circumstances. Air freight is more expensive but keeps supply chains agile, although timeliness is also several days longer than the normal six days ex-works to the destination airport. After a strong double-digit rebound in 2021, market growth will significantly slow this year with world trade flattening and a normalisation in e-commerce growth. Air cargo rates on the Far East-Westbound trade are still four times higher than pre-pandemic, but the competitive position for shippers remains relatively good amid disrupted supply chains.\\nAirfreight capacity remains tight\\nCapacity remains a limiting factor in airfreight through 2022 and the war in Ukraine has curtailed this further. Belly freight capacity has started to return, but not in full yet and compared to the 5-10% larger freight volume there's still a substantial deficit. The global fleet of full freighters increased by a net 40 in two years but this doesn't compensate. And this year, permission for transporting freight in passenger aircraft (e.g., for medical products during the pandemic) ends in the US as well as in the EU (from mid-2022).\\nAirlines, logistics players and container liners rush to set up freighter fleets\\nThe capacity shortage on the freight side has led to various initiatives to expand among airlines, logistics services providers and remarkably also shipping companies. Among others, Emirates, Qantas and Air Canada plan to expand their fleets from 2024 by adding freighters and converting passenger jets.\\nOn the logistics side, Amazon, DHL, UPS, as well as K+N and container liners CMA CGM, Maersk and possibly MSC are expanding and setting up (chartered) freighter fleets and airlines are revaluing the cargo activities as well.

In 2019, Air Canada, together with its Air Canada Express regional partners, carried over 51 million passengers, offering direct passenger service to nearly 220 destinations on six continents. Air Canada is a founding member of Star Alliance\\u2122, providing the world's most comprehensive air transportation network.\\nAir Canada's predecessor, Trans-Canada Air Lines (TCA), inaugurated its first flight on September 1, 1937. The 50-minute flight aboard a Lockheed L-10A carried two passengers and mail between Vancouver and Seattle. By 1964, TCA had grown to become Canada's national airline; it changed its name to Air Canada. The airline became fully privatized in 1989. Air Canada shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX:AC), and effective July 29, 2016, its Class A variable voting shares and Class B voting shares began trading on OTCQX International Premier in the U.S. under the single ticker symbol \\\"ACDVF\\\".\\nAir Canada is among the 20 largest airlines globally. Its corporate headquarters are located in Montreal.\\nhttps://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/about/corporate-profile.html\\n12 May 2023\\nAir Canada Reports First Quarter 2023 Financial Results\\nRecord first quarter passenger revenues of $4.088 billion, more than double the first quarter of 2022, on a 53 per cent increase in operated capacity   \\nRecord first quarter operating revenues of $4.887 billion, 90 per cent higher than first quarter 2022 and about 10 per cent higher than first quarter 2019   \\nOperating loss of $17 million, improved from an operating loss of $550 million in the first quarter of 2022   \\nAdjusted EBITDA* of $411 million with adjusted EBITDA margin* of 8.4 per cent   \\nCash flows from operations of $1.437 billion   \\nTotal liquidity of over $10.5 billion at March 31, 2023   \\nAir Canada today reported its first quarter 2023 financial results.\\nAir Canada's impressive first quarter performance reflects the strength of our brand, the very strong demand environment across all markets and the effective execution of our strategic plan. When compared to the same quarter in 2022, passenger revenues more than doubled and hit a first quarter record of close to $4.1 billion, supported by our diversified network and our strong international franchise. Adjusted EBITDA surged by $554 million to $411 million, and our adjusted CASM* fell nearly seven per cent from a year ago,\\\" said Michael Rousseau, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Canada.\\n\\\"Our first quarter financial results exceeded both internal and external expectations and we expect demand to persist, supported by strong advance bookings for the remainder of the year. For this reason, as well as lower-than-expected fuel costs, we increased our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance last week. I thank all employees for their continued focus on improving all aspects of our company through effective and positive teamwork, and our customers for their loyalty.\\n*Adjusted CASM, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), adjusted EBITDA margin, leverage ratio, net debt, adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share, and free cash flow are referred to in this news release. Such measures are non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP ratios, or supplementary financial measures, are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Refer to the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section of this news release for descriptions of these measures, and for a reconciliation of Air Canada non-GAAP measures used in this news release to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.\\n\\\"All areas of the business contributed meaningfully during the quarter. Air Canada Cargo is expanding its network and fleet, Aeroplan is gaining more members and gross billings have increased 50% when compared to the first quarter of 2022, and Air Canada Vacations produced remarkable results. System yields improved approximately 9 per cent compared to the first quarter of 2022. We achieved a strong free cash flow* of nearly $1 billion. This will allow us to continue investing in our future, including by further deleveraging our balance sheet,\\\" said Mr. Rousseau.\\nFirst Quarter 2023 Financial Results\\nFirst quarter operating revenues of $4.887 billion increased $2.314 billion from the same quarter in 2022, primarily from higher passenger revenues due to increased travel demand. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, operating revenues increased about 10 per cent. Operated capacity increased about 53 per cent from the first quarter of 2022 (about 84 per cent of first quarter 2019 ASMs), in line with the projection provided in Air Canada's February 17, 2023 news release.   \\nOperating expenses of $4.904 billion increased $1.781 billion or 57 per cent from the first quarter of 2022. The increase included the impact of the year-over-year capacity increase, an increase of about 83 per cent in passengers carried and an approximate 30 per cent increase in jet fuel prices.   \\nOperating loss of $17 million, improved from an operating loss of $550 million in the first quarter of 2022.   \\nNet income of $4 million, increased $978 million from the first quarter of 2022. Diluted loss per share of $0.03 compared to a diluted loss per share of $2.72 in the first quarter of 2022.   \\nAdjusted net loss* of $188 million improved $559 million from the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted loss per share* of $0.53 compared to an adjusted loss per share of $2.09 in the first quarter of 2022.   \\nAdjusted CASM (adjusted cost per available seat mile) of 14.52 cents improved 6.9 per cent from the first quarter of 2022. The unit cost improvement resulting from higher operated capacity was partially offset by a favourable maintenance cost adjustment of $159 million recorded in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 CASM of 20.38 cents increased 2.5% from the first quarter of 2022 due to significantly higher fuel prices, higher ground package costs and higher passenger service costs due to higher traffic and higher selling costs, which are largely driven by revenues.   \\nAdjusted EBITDA of $411 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.4 per cent, improved from a negative adjusted EBITDA of $143 million in the first quarter of 2022.   \\nNet cash flows from operating activities of $1.437 billion increased $1.070 billion from the first quarter of 2022.   \\nFree cash flow of $987 million increased $896 million from the first quarter of 2022.   \\nOutlook\\nFor the second quarter of 2023, Air Canada plans to increase its ASM capacity by about 22 per cent from the same quarter in 2022. On May 4, 2023, Air Canada updated its 2023 guidance:\\nAssumptions were made by Air Canada in preparing and making forward-looking statements. As part of its assumptions, Air Canada assumes moderate Canadian GDP growth for 2023, that the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.34 per U.S. dollar for the full year 2023 and that the price of jet fuel will average C$1.09 per litre for the full year 2023.\\nThe revised guidance for adjusted EBITDA reflects expected earnings resulting from an improvement in traffic and yield from a stronger-than-anticipated demand environment and lower-than expected fuel price. The revised guidance for adjusted CASM reflects adjustments to various expense items including those resulting from the higher-than-expected traffic. Air Canada's 2023 capacity guidance remains substantially unchanged.\\nAir Canada also modified the baseline comparison for its 2023 adjusted CASM guidance, comparing it to a 2022 instead of a 2019 baseline. Given the new cost environment, prior comparisons to the 2019 baseline are no longer as meaningful, and comparisons to 2022 are more appropriate.\\nAir Canada is not updating its 2024 targets at this time and will continue evaluating them as it progresses with its plans and executes on its strategic priorities.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nBelow is a description of certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios used by Air Canada to provide readers with additional information on its financial and operating performance. Such measures are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.\\nAdjusted CASM\\nAir Canada uses adjusted CASM to assess the operating and cost performance of its ongoing airline business without the effects of aircraft fuel expense, the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations, impairment of assets, and freighter costs as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis across periods less meaningful and generally allows for a more meaningful analysis of Air Canada's operating expense performance and a more meaningful comparison to that of other airlines.\\nIn calculating adjusted CASM, aircraft fuel expense is excluded from operating expense results as it fluctuates widely depending on many factors, including international market conditions, geopolitical events, jet fuel refining costs and Canada/U.S. currency exchange rates. Air Canada also incurs expenses related to ground packages at Air Canada Vacations which some airlines, without comparable tour operator businesses, may not incur. In addition, these costs do not generate ASMs and therefore excluding these costs from operating expense results provides for a more meaningful comparison across periods when such costs may vary.\\nAir Canada also incurs expenses related to the operation of freighter aircraft which some airlines, without comparable cargo businesses, may not incur. Air Canada had six Boeing 767 dedicated freighter aircraft in its operating fleet as at March 31, 2023 compared to one Boeing 767 dedicated aircraft as at March 31, 2022. These costs do not generate ASMs and therefore excluding these costs from operating expense results provides for a more meaningful comparison of the passenger airline business across periods.\\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to view operating results before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as these costs can vary significantly among airlines due to differences in the way airlines finance their aircraft and other assets. In calculating adjusted EBITDA, Air Canada excludes impairment of assets as this may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis across periods or to other airlines less meaningful.\\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of operating revenues) is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to measure the operating margin before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as these costs can vary significantly among airlines due to differences in the way airlines finance their aircraft and other assets.\\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share - Diluted\\nAir Canada uses adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share - diluted as a means to assess the overall financial performance of its business without the after-tax effects of impairment of assets, foreign exchange gains or losses, net financing expense relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on the sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, and gains or losses on disposal of assets as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful.\\nFor full financial report, see:   https://media.aircanada.com/2023-05-12-Air-Canada-Reports-First-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results\\nSpirit Airlines\\n6 February 2023\\nSpirit Airlines Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results\\nSpirit Airlines, Inc. (\\\"Spirit\\\" or the \\\"Company\\\") (NYSE: SAVE) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results.\\n\\\"I want to thank the entire Spirit Team for their contributions in overcoming the many challenges we faced during 2022. Thanks to their dedication and relentless pursuit to implement more efficient and effective strategies, we made excellent progress on the steps necessary to return Spirit to sustained profitability,\\\" said Ted Christie, Spirit's President and Chief Executive Officer.\\n\\\"Leisure demand has remained strong and our team is doing a great job maximizing revenue production,\\\" Christie continued. \\\"In the fourth quarter 2022, despite a significant number of weather-related flight cancellations during the peak holiday period, our team delivered better-than-expected unit revenue performance. In fact, when adjusting for capacity increases, our unit revenue performance in the fourth quarter was amongst the best in the industry, when compared to 2019.\\\"\\nFourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results\\nFor the fourth quarter 2022, Spirit reported a net loss of $270.7 million, or a net loss of $2.49 per diluted share. Excluding special items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter 2022 was $12.6 million1, or an adjusted net income of $0.12 per diluted share1.\\nFor the fourth quarter 2022, Spirit reported a pre-tax loss of $340.3 million and a pre-tax margin of negative 24.5 percent. Adjusted pre-tax income for the fourth quarter was $23.0 million1 and adjusted pre-tax margin was 1.7 percent1.\\nOperations\\nFor the fourth quarter 2022, the Company's load factor was 81.0 percent, DOT on-time performance2 was\\n73.2 percent and Completion Factor2 was 97.0 percent.\\nRevenue\\nTotal operating revenues for the fourth quarter 2022 were $1.4 billion, an increase of 43.5 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2019 primarily due to increased flight volume and stronger operating yields. Total revenue per ASM (\\\"TRASM\\\") was 10.81 cents, up 17.0 percent compared to fourth quarter 2019 on 22.7 percent more capacity.\\nOn a per passenger flight segment basis, compared to the same period in 2019, total revenue per passenger flight segment (\\\"segment\\\") for the fourth quarter 2022 increased 22.5 percent to $135.62. Compared to the fourth quarter 2019, fare revenue per segment increased 22.1 percent to $64.31 and non-ticket revenue per segment increased 22.9 percent to $71.313. Non-ticket revenue per segment increased sequentially from the third quarter 2022 by $4.24, driven by strong take rates for ancillaries combined with the benefit from revenue management initiatives.\\nCost Performance\\nTotal GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2022 increased 100.8 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2019 to $1,697.0 million. Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2022 increased 58.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2019 to $1,333.7 million4. Compared to the fourth quarter 2019, these increases were primarily driven by increases in flight volume, additional aircraft, higher fuel prices and inflationary wage pressures.\\nCompared to the guidance Spirit gave in mid-December 2022, the Company's total operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2022 came in better-than-expected primarily due to lower airport rents and landing fees driven by operating expense and revenue share adjustments at various airports served by Spirit.\\nAircraft utilization in the fourth quarter 2022 was 10.8 hours, down 7.7 percent compared to the 11.7 hours in the same period of 2019 and a sequential improvement from the third quarter 2022 of 1.9 percent. Continued constraint on flights to and from Florida and staffing challenges limited Spirit's ability to optimize its network and operate its fleet at full utilization in the fourth quarter 2022.\\n\\\"Our team did a great job navigating the various challenges in 2022 and closed the year with better-than- expected results,\\\" said Scott Haralson, Spirit's Chief Financial Officer. \\\"Despite some unexpected setbacks with Geared Turbo Fan (\\\"GTF\\\") engine availability issues, a continued stressed industry infrastructure, and other issues, we have been steadily building back to full fleet utilization and are on track to be close to full fleet utilization by the end of 2023. These issues, together with Airbus aircraft delivery delays, have led us to be more conservative with our capacity planning assumptions for 2023. We now anticipate full year 2023 capacity will be up 19 percent to 22 percent compared to 2022 and that our 2023 CASM ex-fuel will be in the high 6-cent range, which includes approximately 30 basis points of cost pressure related to the recently ratified pilot contract.\\\"\\nFleet\\nSpirit took delivery of 10 new A320neo aircraft during the fourth quarter 2022. The Company ended the quarter with 194 aircraft in its fleet, an increase of 33.8 percent since the end of fourth quarter 2019.\\nIn January 2023, the Company signed an agreement to sell 29 unencumbered A319ceo aircraft powered with V2500 engines to Gryphon Trading Company, LLC (\\\"Gryphon\\\"), with anticipated deliveries to Gryphon beginning in the first quarter 2023 through the end of the third quarter 2024. The Company expects to remove 14 and 15 A319ceo aircraft from its operating fleet in 2023 and 2024, respectively. The other two A319ceo aircraft in our operating fleet are anticipated to be returned to the lessor upon lease expiration in 2025.\\nLiquidity and Capital Deployment\\nSpirit ended fourth quarter 2022 with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term investment securities and liquidity available under the Company's revolving credit facility of $1.8 billion.\\nDuring the fourth quarter 2022, the Company completed a private offering of an additional $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the \\\"Senior Secured Notes\\\") by Spirit IP Cayman Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Spirit Loyalty Cayman Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (together the \\\"Issuers\\\"). As of December 31, 2022, the Issuers had $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.\\nSpirit increased the commitment under its senior secured revolving credit facility by $60.0 million to $300.0 million during the fourth quarter 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the entire $300 million remained undrawn and available.\\nTotal capital expenditures, including net pre-delivery purchase deposits, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, were $246.1 million, primarily related to the purchase of spare parts, including four spare engines, two flight simulators, and expenditures related to the building of Spirit's new headquarters campus in Dania Beach, Florida.\\nForward Looking Guidance\\nThe first quarter and full year 2023 guidance items provided in this release are based on the Company's current estimates and are not a guarantee of future performance.

While Air France-KLM had prepared for close to pre-pandemic demand levels, our airlines are not immune to the major operational challenges taking place around the world. Customer satisfaction is at the top of our priorities and we know we have not fully been able to deliver the quality of service that has come to be expected from us. I would like to thank our customers for their trust and patience. I would also like to express my gratitude towards our employees for their unwavering commitment, even in difficult situations. It is thanks to their dedication and sense of collective responsibility that we are able to post better-than-expected revenues and results this quarter. Going forward we will continue to implement our strategy in order to further transform our organization. We aim to increase our resilience to the changes of our environment while continuing to accelerate our efforts to make our Group and aviation as a whole more sustainable.\\\"\\nOutlook:\\nContext:\\nAir France and KLM are among the most active airlines to accommodate the travel recovery, with a second quarter capacity for Network passenger activity at an index of 82%. Despite the summer growth anticipation efforts since January, operational difficulties arose in Europe and the United States, mainly due to labour shortages at airports.\\nAir France and KLM are doing their utmost to mitigate these challenges and has prioritised safeguarding the trust of our customers. For this quarter, it resulted into 70 million euros additional compensation costs.\\nCapacity\\nIn this recovery context, the Group expects the capacity in Available Seat Kilometers for Air France-KLM Network passenger activity at an index of\\n80% to 85% in the Third quarter of 2022   \\n85% to 90% in the Fourth quarter of 2022   \\nCirca 80% for the Full Year 2022   \\nAll indices compared to the respective period of 2019.\\nThe capacity for Transavia in Available Seat Kilometers is expected at an index above 100 for the full year and in the third and fourth quarter 2022 compared to 2019.\\nYield\\nThe yield environment should remain high for the rest of 2022 with a strong summer demand resulting in yield levels above 2019.\\nExpected operating result\\nSignificantly positive in the third quarter   \\nPositive in 2022, for the first time since 2019   \\nCash\\nAs of June 30 2022, the Group has a strong 11.9 billion euros of liquidity and credit lines at disposal.\\nFull year 2022 Net Capex spending is estimated at circa 2.5 billion euros, which is 80% fleet & fleet related and 20% IT & Ground related.\\nAir France-KLM made major steps to pave the financial trajectory\\nspending is estimated at circa 2.5 billion euros, which is 80% fleet & fleet related and 20% IT & Ground related.   \\nAir France-KLM made major steps to pave the financial trajectory   \\nIn February, Air France-KLM announced plans for a set of equity strengthening measures up to 4 billion euros.   \\nLater in June, the Group successfully completed a 2.3 billion euros rights issue, with CMA-CGM becoming a new strategic shareholder and a reference commercial partner in the cargo activity. Air France-KLM / Air France redeemed 1.6 billion euros of the French State perpetual bonds (including coupon), aiming to redeem at least 75% as soon as possible.   \\nIn the meantime, KLM fully repaid the State backed RCF and direct Dutch State loan amounting for 942 million euros. 2.4 billion euros RCF and State Loan is still available, and KLM expects to strengthen its balance sheet with positive net results and further equity measures are being contemplated.   \\nAir France-KLM and Apollo have closed on the 28th July an investment of 500 million euros by Apollo Funds to finance an ad hoc affiliate of Air France owning a pool of spare engines, as per the agreement signed on July 13th. In alignment with the requirement of article 77 bis of the European Commission's \\\"Temporary Framework for State aid recapitalization measures\\\", proceeds from the investment will be used to further redeem outstanding French State perpetual bonds issued in late April 2021.   \\nLater in 2022-2023, the Group will contemplate possible hybrid bond issuances up to 1.2 billion euros subject to market conditions.   \\nThe restoration of negative equity will be done through net profit generation and quasi/equity projects.\\nAir France-KLM Group: Second quarter operating margin at 2019 level despite the steep increase of fuel cost\\nIn the Second quarter 2022, the Air France-KLM Group posted a positive operating result of 386 million euros, up by 1,145 million euros at a constant currency compared to last year, and was driven by an increase of capacity. In parallel, the increase of load factor and yield generated an increase of the unit revenue.\\nNet income amounted to 324 million euros in the Second quarter 2022, an increase of 1.8 billion euros compared to last year. The recognition of tax assets at KLM group for an amount of around 300 million euros supported the positive net income generation.\\nIn a challenging cost environment, transformation programs contain the unit cost up 2.4% with 15% capacity below 2019.\\nThe unit cost is up 2.4% at a constant fuel price and constant currency versus the Second quarter 2019, with a capacity down by 15%. The ongoing transformation programs enable Air France-KLM to limit the impact of increasing costs such as airport and ATC charges, and the KLM Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) delayed implementation.\\nCompared to June 2019, the number of Full Time Equivalents (FTE's) of Air France excluding Transavia reduced by 16% and by 13% for KLM.\\nStaff costs decreased in the Second quarter by 11% compared to the same quarter in 2019 thanks to FTE reduction and the French government support on wages. Corrected for government support on wages, staff costs decreased by 9%.\\nBusiness review\\nNetwork: Significant improvement in operating result\\nSecond quarter 2022 revenues increased by 137.4% at constant currency to 5,753 million euros. The operating result amounted to 352 million euros, a 1,013 million euros increase at constant currency compared to last year.\\nPassenger network: Double-digit yield increase on most regions and on both economy and premium cabins\\nSecond quarter 2022, capacity in Available Seat Kilometers (ASK) was 69.4% higher than last year and at 82% of 2019 Second quarter level which was in the middle of the Group's guidance provided during the First quarter 2022 results presentation.\\nIn response to the rise in fuel prices and other external costs, the Group proceeded to different fare increases during the first half of the year across all long-haul flights. The amount of the increase varies according to destination and class of travel, and applies to flights operated by Air France and KLM. Additionally, the spike in travel demand, the strong performance in Premium cabins, and the solid corporate traffic recovery have all led to a yield above the 2019 level in the second quarter.\\nThe Second quarter result is driven by a strong performance of the entire network:\\nNorth Atlantic: Strong improvement since mid-January driven by the strong traffic recovery, with strong yield due to fare increases and a positive cabin mix. The second quarter showed new bookings outpacing 2019 levels.   \\nCapacity discipline on South America routes combined with a very resilient demand led to a strong yield. Corporate traffic ramped up quickly in the same time.   \\nAsia: The strong yield performance is due to limited capacity and the group continues to observe important differences between the regions. South East Asia and India showed positive dynamic in yield and traffic.   \\nCaribbean & Indian Ocean: The yields improved thanks to successive fare increases and a positive cabin mix effect.   \\nAfrica: A strong corporate recovery was observed in all areas. For KLM, the performance was driven by East and South Africa with strong yield increase linked to positive cabin mix and a positive economy yield evolution. For Air France, performance was driven by West and Central African countries with a good steering strategy.   \\nMiddle-East: The second quarter performance stayed strong thanks to Dubai, especially on premium cabins and an increased traffic on some routes.   \\nMedium-haul: Strong booking dynamic since March. KLM is impacted by operational challenges and restrictions on flight departures from Amsterdam which led to traffic restriction. The yield is above 2019, especially on leisure routes with network capacity constraints and a positive competition environment.   \\nShort-haul: The network was able to absorb capacity recovery month over month thanks to business motive dynamism. Yield is above 2019 helped by steering yield initiatives.   \\nDuring the Second quarter, Air France added three Airbus 350-900 and two Airbus A220-300. One B777-200, one Airbus 320, three Airbus 319, two Embraer 170 and five Canadair Jet 1000 were phased out. KLM phased in three Embraer 195 E2. The Group will continue to introduce new generation aircraft to its fleet in order to improve its economic and environmental performance.\\nCargo: Strong yield increase mitigates traffic impact on Asia trade lanes\\nCompared to the Second quarter 2021, cargo capacity strongly increased by 27.4% in Available Ton Kilometers, mainly due to the increase in worldwide belly capacity, except for Asia. This limited belly capacity to Asia affected the overall traffic which resulted in a traffic decrease of 17.2% and contributed to an overall decrease in load factor by 27.9 points. Yields, however, remain at a consistently high level (+17.4% vs. 2021), leading to a total Second quarter revenue performance at last year's level.\\nWhen compared to the pre-COVID year 2019, cargo capacity in the Second quarter was still 8% below 2019. However, due to exceptional yield performance - driven by high demand - total revenues in the Second quarter of 2022 were 76% higher than 2019.\\nIn May, Air France-KLM announced its entry into a strategic partnership with CMA-CGM Air Cargo (CCAC). The partnership agreement is currently being worked out and expected to be finalized before the end of 2022.\\nIn June, Air France-KLM Cargo won the Air Cargo Industry Achievement Award for their pioneering work in the development and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel and the fast expansion of its leading SAF program.\\nTransavia: Capacity above pre-crisis level with a load factor of 85%\\nIn the Second quarter of 2022, the demand recovery in leisure traffic in Europe and North Africa continued. Compared to last year, the capacity in the Second quarter increased by 221.9%, traffic increased by 358.2%, and the number of passengers increased by 346.8%. Last year, Second quarter was heavily impacted by travel restrictions in Europe and North Africa.\\nThe Operating result was slightly negative at -18 million euros, although improved by 80 million euros compared to the Second quarter of 2021.\\nCapacity in the Second quarter was above the level of the Second quarter of 2019 and unit revenue even above the Second quarter 2019 mainly driven by a strong yield improvement.\\nThe fleet of Transavia is approaching 100 aircraft, to further capture the strong demand of leisure traffic in Europe.\\nMaintenance business: Operating margin above 2019 level\\nThe Second quarter operating result stood at 57 million euros, an increase of 61 million euros at constant currency versus the Second quarter 2021 thanks to a higher activity and an operational improvement.\\nTotal revenues increased by 34.1% in the Second quarter while third party revenues increased by 35.1%, showing a strong recovery. The increase in internal revenues is consistent with the activity increase of the Air France-KLM airlines compared to the Second quarter 2021.\\nThe operating margin stood at 6.3%, which is 6.7 points higher than the operating results in the Second quarter 2021. The half year margin amounts to 5.8%, which is at the level of the pre-covid period when excluding the states support.\\nDuring the second quarter, Air France-KLM and Apollo Global Management announced the signing of a definitive agreement for Apollo managed funds and entities to make a 500 million euros investment in to an ad hoc operating affiliate of Air France that will own a pool of spare engines dedicated to the airline's Engineering and Maintenance activities.\\nSecond quarter: Positive EBITDA and strong ticket sales reinforces the adjusted operating free cash flow and supports net debt reduction by 2.2 billion euros\\nThe Group generated an adjusted operating free cash flow in the Second quarter 2022 of 1,532 million euros, an increase of 1,322 million euros compared to last year, mainly driven by a positive change in working capital of 1,510 million euros.

While recovering trend in demand is accelerating, various factors including geopolitical risks continue to impact business. ANA HOLDINGS INC. will invest in human resources, aircraft and technology while continuing to restore its financial base, reducing interest-bearing debt.   \\nANA HOLDINGS INC. (hereinafter \\\"ANA HD\\\") today reports its financial results for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.\\nOverview\\nIn the first nine months of fiscal year 2022 (April 1, 2022 - December 31, 2022; hereinafter the \\\"nine months ended December 31, 2022\\\"), passenger demand is rapidly recovering with ease of travel restrictions on domestic flights as well as less entry restrictions in various countries for international flights.\\nUnder these economic and operating conditions, the increased revenue is mainly due to the Air Transportation business that contributed to an operating revenue of 1,258.6 billion yen for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. ANA HD recorded an operating income of 98.9 billion yen, ordinary income of 92.3 billion yen, and net income attributable to owners of the parent was 62.6 billion yen.\\n\\\"With the easing of travel restrictions in the last quarter, we were excited to offer our high-quality customer service to more passengers and serve additional destinations, as reflected by our positive financial performance,\\\" said Kimihiko Nakahori, Executive Vice President and Group Chief Financial Officer of ANA HD. \\\"The ability to do this is a testament to our employees who have persevered over the last few years and worked together to position the ANA Group for the future.\\\"\\nAir Transportation\\nInternational Passenger Service (ANA)   \\nThe number of international passengers increased five times year-on-year, and revenue increased by six times, behind strong demand for connections between North America and Asia as well as business demand from Japan resulting from the easing of entry restrictions in various countries. Demand for travel to Japan began to recover from October with the easing of Japan's border control measures.   \\nANA increased the number of flights on North America and Asia routes to/from Narita Airport to accommodate transit demand, and expanded operations on routes to/from Haneda Airport as well in response to recovering demand to/from Japan. ANA has gradually recovered operations of Europe routes despite the continued impact of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, while flights to/from China remain limited due to continued border restrictions in China.   \\nDomestic Passenger Service (ANA   \\nWith limited impact from the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, passenger demand steadily increased on domestic routes. Starting in October, leisure demand was stimulated by the government's travel support program, and both passenger volume and revenue were 1.9 times higher than in the same period of the previous year.   \\nANA fully resumed operations of the Boeing 777 aircraft with completed engine refurbishment, actively increasing capacity on certain flights and adding extra flights mainly on weekends and holidays in order to meet recovering demand. In October, ANA started code-sharing on flights operated by Amakusa Airline, Inc. and Japan Air Commuter Co., Ltd. for routes such as Fukuoka - Amakusa and Kagoshima - Tanegashima.   \\nCargo Service (ANA)   \\nInternational cargo volume declined year-on-year as a result of less cargo operations utilizing passenger aircraft temporarily dedicated for cargo transport as passenger demand increased, and a decline in demand for automobile-related parts.   \\nDespite a decline in revenue in the third quarter \\uff08October-December\\uff09 compared to the previous quarter due to softening demand, revenue was higher than in the same period of the previous year for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as a result of taking in high-yield cargo such as oversized commercial products and capturing demand between Asia and North America.   \\nLCC (Peach Aviation)   \\nBoth passenger volume and revenue were significantly higher year-on-year due to an increase in demand as a result of eased travel and entry restrictions in Japan as well as in various countries.   \\nIn response to increasing demand on domestic routes, Peach increased frequency on the Narita - Sapporo route and the Narita - Fukuoka route. For international routes, the Seoul and Taipei routes resumed in August, and the Kansai - Bangkok route was newly launched in December after all flights had been suspended since April 2021.   \\nOthers   \\nOther revenue from the Air Transportation business was 107.6 billion yen (up 11.4% year-on-year from 96.6 billion yen). This includes revenue from the mileage program, in-flight sales revenue, revenue from maintenance contracts and other sources.\\nAirline Related, Travel Services, Trade and Retail, and Others\\nAirline Related   \\nRevenue increased from the same period of the previous year, due to increase in airport handling service support, such as check in service and baggage loading, in addition to in-flight meal-related operations that were in line with the recovery in passenger demand, as well as an increase in handling of international cargo volume.   \\nTravel Services   \\nFor domestic travel, as demand steadily recovered and backed by the government's travel support program, the volume of dynamic package products increased for all regions, and \\\"ANA Traveler's Hotel\\\" products performed well. For overseas travel, tours to Hawaii resumed in April for the first time in two years, and tour destinations were also expanded sequentially to various countries. As a result, revenue increased from the same period of the previous year.   \\nWorking to create a \\\"world where people can live on miles,\\\" the ANA Group renewed its \\\"ANA Mileage Club\\\" mobile application in October as a platform where users can access daily life services that are offered by the ANA Group. The ANA Group will further improve convenience by expanding opportunities to \\\"earn and spend miles\\\" both in the daily life scene and online.   \\nTrade and Retail   \\nAs passenger demand recovered, sales increased at ANA FESTA shops in airports and the handling volume of semiconductors for electronics businesses increased. As a result, operating revenue increased from the previous year.   \\nOthers   \\nWhile there was an increase in contracted lounge operation business, revenue declined year-on-year as there was a large sale of property in the previous year in the real estate sector.   \\nhttps://www.anahd.co.jp/group/en/pr/202302/20230202.html?_gl=1*1kz3mal*_ga*NzE4ODQ1MzkzLjE2NzU2NTExMDA.*_ga_32F297W9WL*MTY3NTY1MTEwMC4xLjEuMTY3NTY1MTE2OC4wLjAuMA   ..\\nAmerican Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL)\\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc. was formed on December 9, 2013, with the closing of the merger between American Airlines and US Airways Group.

American and its regional partners operated more than 476,000 flights in the first quarter, with an average load factor of 80.0%.\\nAmerican delivered its best-ever first quarter completion factor and controllable completion factor, resulting in 13 mainline, 11 regional, and five combined mainline and regional zero-cancellation days, a significant improvement over the same period last year. American also outperformed the industry in on-time departures for the quarter, ranking first among the nine largest U.S. carriers.\\nReturning to profitability\\nAmerican produced revenues of $12.2 billion in the quarter, a record for the first quarter and an increase of 37% versus the first quarter of 2022 on 9.2% more capacity. The strong revenue performance was driven by the continued strength of the demand environment. The company produced an operating margin of 3.6% on a GAAP basis and 3.7% excluding the impact of net special items. American produced net income of $10 million in the first quarter on a GAAP basis.\\nDemand for American's product remains strong. Domestic and short-haul international revenue continue to perform well, and the airline has seen noticeable strength in long-haul international demand and yield performance this year.\\nAmerican will make a profit-sharing payment to its team members for the first time in three years. The company has accrued approximately $211 million to its profit-sharing pool, which for the purposes of 2022 was measured as the 12-month period ended March 31, 2023, and will be paid to team members in May.\\nLiquidity and balance sheet\\nAmerican generated record operating and free cash flow of $3.3 billion2 and $3.0 billion2, respectively, in the first quarter. The company reduced total debt4 by more than $850 million in the quarter. Strengthening the balance sheet continues to be a top priority, and the company is approximately 60% of the way to its goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. As of March 31, 2023, American had reduced its total debt by more than $9 billion from peak levels in the second quarter of 2021. The company ended the quarter with approximately $14.4 billion of total available liquidity, comprised of cash and short-term investments plus undrawn capacity under revolving and other short-term credit facilities.\\nGuidance and investor update\\nBased on demand trends and the current fuel price forecast and excluding the impact of special items, the company expects its second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share3 to be between $1.20 and $1.40. American continues to expect its full-year 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share3 to be between $2.50 and $3.50.

The unprecedented disruption caused by COVID-19 to the global aviation industry and the subsequent travel and operational restrictions around the world have continued to affect our business severely. Notwithstanding these challenges, the situation did improve as 2021 progressed.\\nThe second half of the year is traditionally stronger than the first half, and this was the case for us in 2021. The exceptional performance of our cargo business, especially during the second-half peak season, was extremely encouraging. Nevertheless, we continued to face serious challenges and despite the considerable improvement in results in the second half of the year, our overall loss for the full year was still substantial.\\nThe Cathay Pacific Group's attributable loss was HK$5,527 million in 2021 (2020: loss of HK$21,648 million). The loss per ordinary share in 2021 was HK95.1 cents (2020: loss per ordinary share of HK424.3 cents). The Group's attributable profit was HK$2,038 million in the second half of 2021 (2021 first half: loss of HK$7,565 million; 2020 second half: loss of HK$11,783 million). Cathay Pacific reported an attributable profit of HK$3,303 million in the second half of 2021 (2021 first half: loss of HK$5,031 million; 2020 second half: loss of HK$10,032 million).\\nThe loss for 2021 includes impairment and related charges of HK$832 million, mainly relating to 12 aircraft that are unlikely to re-enter meaningful economic service before they retire or are returned to lessors, HK$385 million in restructuring costs and a HK$210 million gain on the dilution of an associate interest in Air China Cargo. This compares to impairment and related charges of HK$4,056 million in 2020 relating to 34 aircraft (and to certain airline service subsidiaries' assets) and HK$2,383 million of restructuring costs. Adjusting for these exceptional items, the Cathay Pacific Group's attributable loss for 2021 was HK$4,520 million (2020: loss of HK$15,209 million), and Cathay Pacific's loss for 2021 was HK$776 million (2020: loss of HK$12,195 million).\\nCathay Pacific celebrated an important milestone in our history in 2021 as we marked 75 years of bringing people together as Hong Kong's home airline. Though we have certainly experienced our share of challenges over the years, COVID-19 key among them, we have also had incredible successes. Throughout our history, we have connected people to new destinations, welcomed the arrival of state-of-the-art aircraft and launched exciting innovations. As our home city has grown, so have we, and we are immensely proud to have represented Hong Kong over the past 75 years and to have helped it grow into one of the leading international aviation hubs in the world.\\nBut 2021 was not just a year for reflecting on our past. The launch of \\\"Cathay\\\", our new premium travel lifestyle brand, has opened an exciting new chapter. Cathay aims to bring all that we love about travel together with everyday lifestyle. This will simplify the way our customers interact with us, including how they earn status and use miles, and will enable us to engage with them not only when they fly with us, but every day.\\nWe also celebrated the inaugural flight of the newest addition to our fleet, the Airbus A321neo, in August. These state-of-the-art passenger aircraft provide the best short-haul experience in the world. Cathay Pacific has already taken delivery of five A321neos and will have 16 in its fleet by the end of 2023.\\nWe continued our commitment to achieving greener aviation by pledging to use sustainable aviation fuel for 10% of Cathay Pacific's total fuel consumption by 2030, and by becoming a founding member of the Aviation Climate Taskforce, a new non-profit organisation founded to tackle the challenge of eliminating carbon emissions in aviation through innovation and collaboration. These initiatives will help the Group achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\\nBusiness performance of Cathay Pacific\\nThe introduction of strict quarantine requirements for Hong Kong-based aircrew in February 2021 had a substantial impact on our travel business. To operate the remaining schedules, we introduced voluntary closed-loop duty cycles for our Hong Kong-based aircrew, comprising a 21-day duty cycle followed by a 14-day quarantine period. These arrangements have been very demanding for our aircrew and we are incredibly appreciative to them for their support and their tireless professionalism in the face of extremely challenging circumstances.\\nOperational and travel restrictions remained in place throughout the year, and this heavily constrained our ability to operate more flights. We reduced our flight schedule towards the end of December in response to the latest crew quarantine requirements in Hong Kong, and ended the year operating a considerably smaller amount of our pre-COVID-19 passenger capacity than we had planned.\\nComparing 2021 with 2020 as a whole, the operating performance in 2021 was generally weaker due in large part to the first two months of 2020 being relatively strong ahead of the full impact of COVID-19. Passenger revenue decreased by 61.6% to HK$4,346 million in 2021 compared with 2020. Revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) decreased by 79.5%. Capacity, measured in available seat kilometres (ASK), was down by 61.8%. We carried 717 thousand passengers, an average of 1,965 per day, 84.5% fewer than in 2020. Passenger load factor was 31.1% compared with 58.0% in 2020.\\nOur cargo business performed exceptionally well. Cargo revenue in 2021 was HK$32,377 million, an increase of 31.8% compared to 2020. Cargo revenue tonne kilometres (RFTK) decreased by 1.1%. Capacity, measured by available cargo tonne kilometres (AFTK), decreased by 10.9%. Load factor increased by 8.1 percentage points to 81.4%. Yield increased by 33.1% to HK$3.94.\\nCargo demand grew ahead of the traditional peak season in the second half of the year. In the months leading up to the end of 2021, we operated our freighter fleet at peak capacity, and supplemented our cargo capacity with additional cargo-only passenger flight operations. We also operated six of our Boeing 777-300ER passenger aircraft that have been partially converted into \\\"preighters\\\" by removing some of the seats in the passenger cabins to provide additional cargo-carrying capacity. In October, we carried more than 136,000 tonnes of cargo - the most we have carried in a single month since the start of COVID-19. Our airlines have carried more than 190 million COVID-19 vaccines since the start of COVID-19.\\nWe remained focused on effective cash and cost management. Executive pay was cut for the whole of 2021 and we introduced a third unpaid leave scheme in the first half of the year, with an 80% voluntary uptake. Employee furlough, leave without pay, voluntary separation and early retirement schemes were implemented for a broad range of employee groups, and we are extremely grateful to all of our employees who participated in such schemes. Overall, our non-fuel costs decreased by 24.4% to HK$37,708 million. Cathay Pacific's total fuel costs (before the effect of fuel hedging) increased by HK$927 million (or 11.9%) compared to 2020. This reflected increased fuel prices.\\nBusiness performance of other subsidiaries and associates\\nHK Express reported a loss of HK$1,978 million for 2021 (2020: loss of HK$1,723 million). The results were adversely affected by low demand for passenger travel and by COVID-19-related travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, including those affecting Hong Kong-based aircrew.\\nAir Hong Kong recorded a profit in 2021, benefitting from strong cargo demand. The all-cargo airline flew extra sectors for Cathay Pacific.\\nOur airline services subsidiaries' financial performance was better than in 2020.\\nAir China (accounted for three months in arrears) was adversely affected by COVID-19. Its results were worse than those in 2020.\\nFinancial position\\nThe exceptionally strong cargo performance, together with our continued focus on effective cash and cost management, had a positive impact on our monthly operating cash burn, to the extent that we were marginally cash generative in the second half of 2021.\\nAt 31st December 2021, our available unrestricted liquidity balance was HK$30.3 billion. During the year we raised HK$6.7 billion from a convertible bond issue and US$650 million (equivalent to HK$5.1 billion) from a straight bond issue under our medium-term note programme. We welcomed the Hong Kong SAR Government's agreement to extend the drawdown period of the HK$7.8 billion loan facility made available as part of our 2020 recapitalisation by 12 months to June 2022. This provides us with more flexibility to manage our liquidity position.\\nProspects\\nWe have had an extremely challenging start to 2022. Following the emergence of the Omicron variant, the HKSAR Government tightened the quarantine requirements for Hong Kong-based aircrew, notably those operating cargo flights, and temporarily banned all flights from nine countries, including the UK and the US, which are major markets for us. Passengers from high-risk places were banned from transiting through Hong Kong International Airport. All this constrained our ability to operate flights as planned. As a result, we expect to operate around 2% of pre-COVID-19 passenger flight capacity, and our cargo flight capacity is likely to remain less than one-third of pre-COVID-19 levels while current restrictions remain in place. We are trying our best to maintain our passenger and cargo networks as far as possible and will try to increase our cargo capacity as much as practicable.\\nAs Hong Kong goes through a particularly challenging phase of this pandemic, I'd like to express my empathy and concern for all the people across Hong Kong who are affected. In the early days of COVID-19, Cathay Pacific crew bravely volunteered to operate evacuation flights to bring Hong Kong people home, and during this latest phase, we are doing everything we can to support the city, bringing in vaccines, rapid antigen test kits and essential food and medical supplies, and working with the authorities to support the pandemic response.\\nAs Hong Kong's home airline, we are resolutely committed to keeping the flow of people and cargo between Hong Kong and the rest of the world safely moving, and to protecting and enhancing the city's aviation hub status despite the challenging circumstances presented by COVID-19. We have absolute confidence in the long-term future of Hong Kong. Everything we do at Cathay Pacific is in the service of Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific has been proudly serving our home city as its de facto flag carrier through thick and thin for over 75 years.\\nWe are excited by the possibilities provided by the launch of our new premium travel lifestyle brand and we will continue to launch new offers and enhancements that will give our customers more reasons to travel, to shop and to interact with us. Our commitments to sustainable aviation will continue as we strive to reach our net-zero target by 2050, and we will further build on our digital leadership capabilities. We continue to position ourselves to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the Greater Bay Area, and the growth potential afforded by the opening of the third runway at Hong Kong International Airport.\\nThough we are still facing many challenges, we have the utmost confidence in the long-term future of Cathay Pacific. We have been privileged to fly out of Hong Kong as its home airline for the past 75 years and, as those years have shown, Cathay Pacific is an enduring airline.\\nFinally, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all of our people, who have been working tirelessly to keep the airline operating under incredibly challenging conditions. In particular, I would like to thank our aircrew, who have kept Hong Kong safely connected to the world under the most difficult conditions for any airline anywhere in the world. In 2021, our crew spent more than 62,000 nights in quarantine hotels. In addition, over 1,000 of our people, many of them aircrew, but also people from our services, operations and head office teams, have spent over 11,000 nights in the Penny's Bay quarantine facility. Collectively, our crew took over 230,000 COVID-19 tests in 2021, with only 16 positive cases despite our people, who are of course all fully vaccinated, flying continuously to many of the highest-risk countries in the world. The professionalism they have shown in upholding safe operations throughout this period have been unparalleled.\\nFor the full financial report, see\\nhttps://www.cathaypacific.com/content/dam/cx/about-us/investor-relations/announcements/en/2021_cx_annual_results_en.pdf\\nChina Eastern Airlines (SHA: 600115)\\nHeadquartered in Shanghai, China Eastern Air Holding Company (CEAH) is among China's three major air transportation groups.

Their performance coupled with strong demand drove nearly $2 billion of free cash flow as well as profitability in the first half of the year, and we are accruing profit sharing, marking a great milestone for our people,\\\" said Ed Bastian, Delta's chief executive officer. \\\"For the September quarter, we expect an adjusted operating margin of 11 to 13 percent, supporting our outlook for meaningful full year profitability.\\\"\\nJune Quarter 2022 GAAP Financial Results:\\nOperating revenue of $13.8 billion   \\nOperating income of $1.5 billion with operating margin of 11.0 percent   \\nEarnings per share of $1.15   \\nOperating cash flow of $2.5 billion   \\nTotal debt and finance lease obligations of $24.8 billion   \\nJune Quarter 2022 Adjusted Financial Results\\nOperating revenue of $12.3 billion, 99 percent recovered versus June quarter 2019 on 82 percent capacity restoration   \\nOperating income of $1.4 billion with operating margin of 11.7 percent, the first quarter of double-digit margin since 2019   \\nEarnings per share of $1.44   \\nFree cash flow of $1.6 billion after investing $864 million into the business   \\nPayments on debt and finance lease obligations of $1.0 billion   \\n$13.6 billion in liquidity* and adjusted net debt of $19.6 billion   \\nSeptember Quarter Outlook\\nFuel price guidance is based on prices as of July 8th, including Brent at $107 per barrel, cracks at $41 per barrel and $0.27 per gallon refinery contribution.\\nJune Quarter Revenue Environment and Outlook\\n\\\"With growing demand across our network in the June quarter, we recaptured higher fuel prices and delivered adjusted revenue recovery of 99 percent with unit revenues up 20.5 percent versus 2019.

The unprecedented ramp up across the aviation industry, coupled with a tight labour market, has resulted in widespread operational challenges culminating in higher levels of cancellations than normal.\\nDespite this, easyJet operated 95% of its planned schedule in Q3.\\nAction taken to remove capacity and build resilience into Q4, due to caps imposed by London Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol alongside wider challenges within Europe has resulted in July operations to date being much improved. easyJet remains focused on ensuring smooth operations this summer and will continue to fine tune our schedule if required.\\nAirline ancillary yield per passenger of \\u00a322.07 continues to outperform pre pandemic levels, up 55% on the same period in 2019. easyJet holidays generated \\u00a316m of profit in the quarter as it carried 0.4 million customers, passing its previous highest profit of \\u00a310m4 in a full year. The holidays business remains on track to carry 1.1m passengers in the full year.\\nBookings have built through the quarter as demand for easyJet's leading network remains solid. Q4 is currently 71% booked, load factor slightly ahead of 2019 and sold ticket yield is 13% above FY19.\\neasyJet is seeing yields track positively through the first half of FY23, with October half-term currently booked in line with FY19 on capacity at 95% of FY19 levels.\\nCommenting, Johan Lundgren, easyJet Chief Executive said:\\n\\\"Delivering for customers this summer remains our highest priority. During the quarter we carried seven times more customers than the same time last year and operated 95% of our schedule. We have taken action to build the additional resilience needed this summer and the operation has now normalised.\\n\\\"Despite the loss this quarter due to the short-term disruption issues, the return to flying at scale has demonstrated that the strategic initiatives launched during the pandemic are delivering now and with more\\nto come. This includes a step-change in ancillary yields, increasing 55% versus the same period in 2019, and a record profit of \\u00a316m generated in the quarter by easyJet holidays which is on track to serve 1.1 million customers in the full year.\\n\\\"easyJet expects capacity to be c.90% of Q419 across our network of major European airports, with load factors targeted above 90%.\\\"\\nCapacity\\nDuring Q3 easyJet flew 87% of FY19 capacity2, in line with the guidance and a significant increase on the same period\\nlast year where easyJet flew 16% of FY19 capacity. Load factor was 88%, as guided, due to increasing customer demand post travel restrictions easing.\\nPassenger1 numbers in the quarter increased to 22.0 million (Q3 FY21: 3.0 million).\\nFinancials\\nTotal group revenue for the quarter ending 30 June 2022 increased to \\u00a31,755 million (Q3 FY21: \\u00a3213 million). Passenger revenue increased to \\u00a31,152 million (Q3 FY21: \\u00a3152 million) and ancillary revenue increased to \\u00a3603 million (Q3 FY21: \\u00a361 million) primarily due to the increase in capacity flown. Airline ancillary revenue per seat of \\u00a319.47 (Q3 FY21: \\u00a313.14) continues to benefit from cabin bags and bundles delivering incremental revenue.\\nGroup headline costs for the quarter ending 30 June 2022 were \\u00a31,869 million (Q3 FY21: \\u00a3531 million), primarily driven by the higher level of capacity flown compared to the same period last year as well as the operational challenges seen through the period which have resulted in \\u00a3133m of disruption costs.\\nGroup headline loss before tax for the quarter ending 30 June 2022 was \\u00a3114 million, a \\u00a3204 million improvement compared to the \\u00a3318 million loss in Q3 FY21. Included in the headline loss was a \\u00a336 million loss from balance sheet FX revaluations.\\neasyJet continues to have a strong investment grade balance sheet and has one of the lowest net debts in European aviation. As at 30 June 2022, easyJet's net debt was \\u00a30.2 billion (31 March 2022: \\u00a30.6 billion) including cash and cash equivalents and money market deposits of \\u00a33.9 billion.\\nDisruption management and current operations\\nAs previously disclosed, proactive action was taken to build in additional resilience including the consolidation of capacity in Q3 and Q4, in conjunction with other measures. Given easyJet's high frequency network, over 70% of affected customers were moved onto an alternate flight within 24 hours.\\nWe believe that these capacity/cost impacts are a one-off this summer as we would expect all parties to build greater resilience in time for 2023 peak periods.\\nSlot addition\\nDuring the third quarter easyJet won 18 daily slots (9 slot pairs) at Lisbon airport, achieving growth in a highly slot constrained airport. These slots will result in easyJet becoming the second largest airline at the airport. The additional capacity enabled by the new slots will be deployed starting in October.\\nApproved aircraft purchase\\nAfter obtaining shareholder approval earlier this month, easyJet has agreed to purchase an additional 56 A320neo family aircraft for delivery between FY26 and FY29, as well as converting 18 planned deliveries of A320neo aircraft to 18 A321 neo aircraft. These aircraft will continue the modernisation of the easyJet fleet, delivering both cost and sustainability benefits to easyJet, as well as facilitating further up-gauging of the fleet.\\nSustainability\\neasyJet has signed a Letter of Intent with Airbus to support the development of carbon removal technology and to explore the opportunity to secure a future supply of carbon removal credits from direct air capture technology.\\nIn addition, easyJet and Rolls-Royce announced a ground-breaking new partnership to develop technology for hydrogen combustion engines with the potential to power narrow body aircraft. Both parties have agreed to work together on a series of engine tests on the ground starting later this year, and also have a shared ambition to take the technology to the air.\\neasyJet has committed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and we believe that zero carbon emission technology will ultimately enable us to achieve \\\"net-zero\\\" flying. easyJet remains committed to net zero and will announce its Net Zero Pathway later this year.\\nOutlook\\neasyJet currently expects capacity in Q4 to be c.90% of Q4'19 with load factors above 90%. easyJet's Q4 schedule is now 71% booked, 1ppt ahead of this point in FY19.

The Group's revenue was AED 66.2 billion (US$ 18.1 billion), an increase of 86% over last year's results. The Group's cash balance was AED 25.8 billion (US$ 7.0 billion), up 30% from last year mainly due to strong demand across its core business divisions and markets, triggered by the easing of pandemic-related restrictions.\\nHis Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates Airline and Group, said: \\\"This year, we focussed on restoring our operations quickly and safely wherever pandemic-related restrictions eased across our markets. Business recovery picked up pace particularly in the second half of the year. Robust customer demand drove a huge improvement in our financial performance compared to our unprecedented losses of last year and we built up our strong cash balance.\\n\\\"The health and safety of our people and customers remained a key priority as the world navigated its second full year of the pandemic. Across Emirates and dnata, we responded to dynamic market conditions with agility, and introduced innovative products and services to meet our customers' needs and provide them with the best possible experience.\\n\\\"2021-22 was also a significant year as the UAE marked its 50th anniversary and hosted the world at Expo 2020 Dubai which generated increased global engagement and visitation to the UAE. The Emirates Group was proud to play our part in contributing to the Expo's success and to the UAE's jubilee events.\\\"\\nIn 2021-22, Emirates received a further capital injection of AED 3.5 billion (US$ 954 million) from its ultimate shareholder, the Government of Dubai, and the Group tapped on various industry support programmes and availed a total relief of nearly AED 0.8 billion in 2021-22.\\nAs Emirates and dnata ramped up operations, employees previously on furlough or made redundant were recalled and rehired, and new recruitment drives were held to replenish the Group's talent pool and boost its future capabilities. As a result, the Group's total workforce increased by 13% to 85,219 employees, representing over 160 different nationalities.\\nIn 2021-22, the Group collectively invested AED 7.9 billion (US$ 2.2 billion) in new aircraft and facilities, and the latest technologies to position the business for recovery and future growth. It also continued to progress its environmental strategy focussed on reducing carbon emissions, consuming resources responsibly, and conserving wildlife and habitats. During the year, the Group supported community, humanitarian and philanthropic initiatives in its various markets, as well as innovation incubators, and other programmes that nurture future solutions for industry growth.\\nSheikh Ahmed said: \\\"For the Emirates Group, 2021-22 was largely about recovery, after the toughest year in our Group's history. It's not just about restoring our capacity, but also augmenting our future capabilities as we rebuild. Our aim is to build back better and stronger, so that we can deliver even better experiences to our customers and offer more support to the communities we serve.\\n\\\"We expect the Group to return to profitability in 2022-23, and are working hard to hit our targets, while keeping a close watch on headwinds such as high fuel prices, inflation, new COVID-19 variants, and political and economic uncertainty.\\n\\\"Our steady investments in infrastructure, technology, people, and partnerships, will continue to give us the ability and advantage in delivering industry-leading products and value to our customers. As Dubai and the UAE move ahead with its strategy for the next 50 years and beyond, the Emirates Group is well positioned to play our role in contributing to economic growth, facilitating global engagement, and making a positive impact on people and communities.\\\"\\nEmirates performance\\nEmirates' total passenger and cargo capacity increased by 47% to 36.4 billion ATKMs in 2021-22, as the airline continued to reinstate passenger services across its network in line with the lifting of pandemic-related flight and travel restrictions.\\nFrom 120 destinations at the start of the financial year, to increased operations and capacity growth across over 140 destinations by 31 March 2022, Emirates was able to respond dynamically to serve customer demand wherever opportunities arose, thanks to the resilience of its people and business model. In July, the airline launched a new route to Miami, bringing its total passenger gateways in the US to 12.\\nTo serve the strong rebound in travel demand, Emirates deployed its flagship A380 aircraft to even more cities during the year, bringing its A380 network to 29 destinations as of 31 March 2022.\\nHelping travellers access even more destinations, in 2021-22, Emirates reinforced its strategic partnerships with Qantas and flydubai, and expanded its interline and codeshare partnerships across Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia including with: Aeromar, airBaltic, Airlink, Azul, Cemair, Garuda Indonesia, Gulf Air, Maldivian, South African Airways and TAP Air Portugal. Emirates also signed agreements and launched initiatives with tourism partners in various destinations to support travel and tourism recovery.\\nEmirates received its final five new A380 aircraft during the financial year, all equipped with its latest cabin interiors including Premium Economy seats. It also phased out 2 older aircraft comprising of 1 Boeing 777-300ER and 1 Freighter, leaving its total fleet count at 262 at the end of March. Emirates' average fleet age remains at a youthful 8.2 years.\\nEmirates' order book of 197 aircraft remains unchanged at this time. The airline is firmly committed to its long-standing strategy of operating a modern and efficient fleet, which underscores its \\\"Fly Better\\\" brand promise, as young aircraft are better for the environment, better for operations, and better for customers.\\nWith significantly enhanced capacity deployment across most markets, Emirates' total revenue for the financial year increased 91% to AED 59.2 billion (US$ 16.1 billion). Currency fluctuations this year impacted the airline's profitability negatively by AED 348 million (US$ 95 million).\\nTotal operating costs increased by 30% from last financial year. Cost of ownership (depreciation and amortisation) and fuel cost were the two biggest cost components for the airline in 2021-22, followed by employee cost. Fuel accounted for 23% of operating costs compared to 14% in 2020-21. The airline's fuel bill more than doubled to AED 13.9 billion (US$ 3.8 billion) compared to the previous year, driven by a higher uplift of 66% in line with capacity expansion and a higher average fuel price which was up by 75%.\\nWith the removal of pandemic-related flight and travel restrictions globally, the airline managed to substantially improve its financial results and reported a loss of AED 3.9 billion (US$ 1.1 billion) after last year's AED 20.3 billion (US$ 5.5 billion) loss, and a loss margin of 6.6%, significantly improved compared to 65.6% last year.\\nEmirates carried 19.6 million passengers (up by 199%) in 2021-22, with seat capacity up by 150%. The airline reports a Passenger Seat Factor of 58.6%, compared with last year's passenger seat factor of 44.3%; and a 10% decline in passenger yield to 35.1 fils (9.6 US cents) per Revenue Passenger Kilometre (RPKM), due to the change in route mix, fares and currency. Seat load factor and yield results cannot be compared against the previous year's performance due to the ongoing unusual pandemic situation.\\nEmirates continued to invest in its products and services to deliver ever better customer experiences. This year, it announced a major retrofit programme to equip 120 of its 777 and A380 aircraft with its new Premium Economy seats and the latest cabin interiors.\\nIt also accelerated digital initiatives to provide customers with smoother and safer journeys, from the quick and secure verification of COVID-19 travel documents, to more biometrics and contactless touchpoints at its Dubai hub.\\nEmirates continued to lead the industry with initiatives that provide customer assurance as travel restrictions eased and more people made travel plans. It extended its generous rebooking waivers and complimentary COVID-19 medical cover for all customers; and introduced new ways for Emirates Skywards members to earn Miles while extending the expiry of miles and tier status.\\nIn this 2nd pandemic year, Emirates SkyCargo once again put in a stellar performance and contributed to 40% of the airline's total transport revenue through its ability to respond rapidly to changing demand patterns in a distorted global marketplace.\\nEmirates SkyCargo maintained its edge in the global airfreight industry by focusing its customers, bringing innovative solutions to the market, and leveraging its fleet and network capabilities.\\nRebuilding its network and capacity, the cargo division intelligently deployed its freighter fleet and belly-hold capacity, to meet customer needs. By 30 June 2021, it had restored services to over 90% of its pre-pandemic network.\\nDuring the year, Emirates SkyCargo continued to play an important role in getting COVID-19 vaccines and other medical supplies to communities around the world, and keeping trade lanes open for food supplies, e-commerce and other essential goods. In June 2021, it invested to scale up its pharma cool chain infrastructure in Dubai and by March 2022, Emirates SkyCargo had transported 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines.\\nAt the Dubai Airshow 2021, Emirates announced a US$ 1 billion investment to acquire 2 new Boeing 777 freighters and convert 4 existing 777-300ER aircraft into freighters.\\nWith steady and strong air freight demand throughout the year, Emirates' cargo division reported a new record revenue of AED 21.7 billion (US$ 5.9 billion), an increase of 27% over last year.\\nFreight yield per Freight Tonne Kilometre (FTKM) decreased by 3% as more cargo capacity returned to the global market, but generally remained at high levels compared to the pandemic marketplace due to steady and strong demand.\\nTonnage carried increased by 14% to reach 2.1 million tonnes, due to the growth in available bellyhold capacity for the entire year with the reinstatement of more passenger services. At the end of 2021-22, Emirates' SkyCargo's total freighter fleet stood at 10 Boeing 777Fs.\\nEmirates' hotels portfolio doubled revenue over last year to AED 602 million (US$ 164 million) as it re-opened more facilities to serve the upswing in tourism traffic and the gradual recovery of the meetings and conferences industry.\\nDuring the year, Emirates successfully restructured and extended various aircraft leases. The support from aviation lessors and financing partners during these challenging times reflect the financial community's confidence in Emirates' business model, and its mid to longer term prospects.\\nIn addition to the AED 9.7 billion (US$ 2.6 billion) financing that was raised for aircraft and general corporate purposes in 2021-22, Emirates has already received committed offers to finance two aircraft deliveries due in 2022-23.\\nEmirates closed the financial year with solid cash assets of AED 20.9 billion (US$ 5.7 billion), 38% higher compared to 31 March 2021.\\ndnata performance\\nRecovery from the pandemic was felt across all dnata businesses, and in 2021-22 dnata returned to profitability with a profit of AED 110 million (US$ 30 million).\\nWith growing flight and travel activity across the world, dnata's total revenue increased by 54% to AED 8.6 billion (US$ 2.3 billion). dnata's international business accounts for 62% of its revenue.\\ndnata continued to lay the foundations for future growth with investments in 2021-22 amounting to AED 370 million (US$ 101 million).\\nDuring the year, dnata invested significantly in its cargo handling capabilities. It expanded existing facilities in Sydney, Australia; opened a state-of-the-art cargo centre at London Heathrow airport; and announced a fully automated cargo centre to be built at 'dnata Cargo City' at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. It also introduced an advanced \\\"OneCargo\\\" system which digitises and automates business and operational functions at its Iraq cargo operations, with plans to roll out the system across its global cargo network.\\nIn 2021-22, dnata's operating costs increased by 14% to AED 8.4 billion (US$ 2.3 billion), in line with expanded operations in its Airport Operations, Catering and Travel divisions across the world.\\ndnata's cash balance improved by AED 208 million to AED 4.9 billion (US$ 1.3 billion). Net cash used in financing activities, primarily payments for loans and leases, amounted to AED 745 million (US$ 203 million), while the business utilised net cash of AED 246 million (US$ 67 million) in essential investing activities. The business saw a positive operating cash flow of AED 1.2 billion (US$ 332 million) in 2021-22, a reflection of the substantial improvements in revenues.\\nRevenue from dnata's Airport Operations, including ground and cargo handling increased to AED 5.7 billion (US$ 1.6 billion).\\nThe number of aircraft turns handled by dnata globally grew by 82% to 527,501, cargo handled increased by 10% to 3.0 million tonnes, reflecting the increase in flight activity across the globe as dnata's customers re-started their operations wherever market restrictions on flights and travel were lifted.\\nDuring 2021-22, dnata expanded its global airport operations footprint into Africa. It signed a concession agreement with The Government of Zanzibar, where dnata will oversee the operations of the island's newly-built international terminal with its partners, including Emirates Leisure Retail (ELR) who will partner with MMI as master concessionaire for all food and beverage, duty free and commercial outlets at the terminal.\\nmarhaba, dnata's airport hospitality brand, marked its 30th year of operations with the launch of its signature meet and greet services at four of Australia's major airports, a new lounge in Zurich Airport, and a re-designed experience at its flagship lounge at Dubai International.\\ndnata's Catering business accounted for AED 1.7 billion (US$ 455 million) of dnata's revenue, up by 60%. The inflight catering business uplifted 39.9 million meals to airline customers, more than double the number of meals from last year, as its airline customers across the world restored their flight operations.\\nSignificant customer wins during the year include BA CityFlyer, which led to dnata Catering launching operations at London City Airport; and the global inflight retail services contract for easyJet where dnata's team of inflight retail experts will develop and manage bespoke onboard retail programmes and solutions for the airline.\\nIt also saw significant activity in Australia. As the country re-opened its borders to international travellers, dnata worked closely with airline customers to support their resumption of flight operations. dnata Catering also continued to grow its retail food business with ready-made meals developed by Snapfresh Australia launched in Aldi and Costco stores nationwide.\\nRevenue from dnata's Travel Services division has significantly grown by 434% to AED 694 million (US$ 189 million). The reported total transaction value (TTV) of travel services sold increased by 912% to AED 2.3 billion (US$ 632 million), a dramatic reversal from last year. These increases reflect last year's abnormal situation where the business saw high levels of COVID-19-related booking cancellations.\\nDuring the year, dnata introduced several new products and services in the UAE, capitalising on its market expertise, Dubai's open borders for international travel, the city's hosting of Expo 2020 as well as other major conferences and sporting events.\\nFor its corporate travel customers, dnata partnered with ExpensePoint to offer an advanced expense reporting solution; renewed a partnership with one of the world's largest VAT reclaim specialists that will bring additional saving opportunities for duty travel claims; and implemented hybrid meetings and events solutions to provide customers a sustainable alternative to hosting corporate engagements during lockdown.\\nIn the UK, dnata's Travel Republic brand introduced a new 'Secure Trust Account' for package holiday customers that guarantees prompt refunds for customers who have to cancel their flight-inclusive package holiday, as funds are kept secure in a separate account.\\ndnata also launched its Gold Medal brand in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia this year, offering its extensive portfolio of travel products to independent travel agents.\\nhttps://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-group-announces-2021-22-results/\\nEtihad Airways\\nEtihad Airways is the second flag carrier of the United Arab Emirates.

This included its best monthly results to date for February, prior to the impact of COVID-19, the subsequent closure of international borders, and the suspension of flights to and from the UAE from 24 March.\\nH1 2020 performance\\nEtihad carried 3.5 million passengers in H1 (H1 2019: 8.2 million), a reduction of 58% from the same period the previous year. Average seat load factor was 71%. Core operating loss for this period increased by US$ 172 million to US$ 758 million (H1 2019: US$ 586 million), driven by a 38% drop in revenues, which stood at US$ 1.7 billion (H1 2019: US$ 2.7bn). This was partially offset by a 27% reduction in direct operating costs to US$ 1.9 billion (H1 2019: US$ 2.7 billion), and a 21% reduction in general and administrative expenses to US$ 0.40 billion (H1 2019: US$ 0.50), both driven by management cost containment initiatives and reduced operations. Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) reduced by 53% to 23.69 billion (H1 2019: 50.35 billion).\\nCargo revenues were US$ 0.49 billion, an improvement of US$ 130 million (37%) compared to the same period in 2019, with 254,345 leg tonnes of cargo carried. This was driven by an increase in demand and a spike in cargo fares.\\nThe core operating result for the first three months of the year improved by 34%, despite the onset of COVID-19, with a 12% reduction in passenger numbers, and a 9.5% reduction in ASK. Q1 seat load factor was 74% (January's performance was significantly stronger than the same month in 2019, with a seat load factor of 81.9%), and yield at US$ 5.92 cents. Unit revenue in Q1 reduced by 3.3% to US$ 4.14 cents (Q1 2019: US$ 4.28 cents), offset by continuous focus on driving down unit costs, which were reduced by 2.4% to US$ 7.01 cents (Q1 US$ 7.18 cents).\\nHowever, the airline saw a significant decrease in Q2 operating revenues following COVID-19 flight suspensions, with 70% of its fleet grounded. This period registered a 99% drop in passenger numbers and a 95% drop in ASK compared to Q2 2019. Seat load factor for this period was 16%, mainly driven by the operation of special (repatriation) flights, and the resumption of a limited network of transfer services via Abu Dhabi in early June.\\nTony Douglas, Group Chief Executive Officer, Etihad Aviation Group, said: \\\"Etihad faced a set of enormous and unpredictable challenges in the first six months of the year. We started 2020 strong and recorded encouraging results as part of our continuing transformation programme. This left us in a relatively robust position when COVID-19 hit, allowing us to act with agility, and to mobilise all available resources as the crisis deepened, taking major steps to reduce costs through a wide-reaching series of measures.\\n\\\"While we have revised our outlook for the rest of 2020 based on current realities, we remain optimistic that as international borders re-open, we will increase our flying and carry more guests securely and with greater peace of mind, supported by the Etihad Wellness programme and our new Wellness Ambassadors. By September, we aim to increase our worldwide flights to half our pre-COVID-19 capacity. Looking forward, we rest assured that the UAE is leading the way in the research for a vaccine against COVID-19. The incredible efforts Abu Dhabi is making to ensure the safety and security of its residents and visitors will soon enable us to welcome the world back to our amazing home. This commitment was successfully highlighted by the recent hosting of major UFC events in the capital.\\\"\\nEtihad operated up to 40 of its fleet of 97 passenger aircraft in Q2, including Boeing 787 Dreamliner, 777-300ERs, and Airbus A320 family aircraft as belly-hold cargo freighters to complement Etihad Cargo's operational fleet of six 777-200F freighters. Between 25 March and 15 June, over 640 special passenger flights were operated to 45 online and offline destinations, using the passenger cabins of these aircraft to fly foreign nationals out of the UAE, and to bring UAE nationals back home.\\nAdam Boukadida, Chief Financial Officer, Etihad Aviation Group, said: \\\"This year started strong, riding on the positive momentum gained in 2019, and by the end of the first quarter, the airline was on track to achieve a 2020 EBITDA of US$ 900 million (2019: US$ 453 million). Etihad managed to maintain a satisfactory level of liquidity despite a major drop in revenues, while continuing to raise new liquidity facilities supported by local and international financial institutions. This was supported by maintaining an 'A with a stable outlook' Fitch rating in April, at the height of the pandemic. Etihad was one of a small number of airlines to maintain its pre-COVID-19 credit rating.\\n\\\"A greater emphasis is being placed on a drive towards increased cost optimisation and efficiencies across the entire business to face the hurdles placed in our way by COVID-19. Our suppliers and partners have also worked closely with us, including the arrangement of payment holidays with lessors and savings discussions with all of our supply chain, so we can re-emerge stronger together.\\\"\\nNetwork\\nEtihad is gradually resuming services to more destinations across its global network. This follows the easing of travel restrictions by UAE regulatory authorities on outbound and inbound travel for citizens and residents. All travel remains subject to the entry and health regulations set by the UAE authorities, and those at the end destination.\\nThroughout August and September, subject to the lifting of international restrictions and the re-opening of individual markets, the airline aims to fly to 61 destinations worldwide from its Abu Dhabi hub, operating approximately 50 per cent of its pre-COVID capacity.\\nSubject to the applicable government approvals, Etihad's summer schedule will feature a wider network and increased frequencies to the following destinations from, to, or via Abu Dhabi:\\nMiddle East & Africa: Amman, Bahrain, Beirut, Cairo, Casablanca, Dammam, Jeddah, Kuwait, Muscat, Rabat, Riyadh, Seychelles Europe: Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Belgrade, Brussels, Dublin, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Geneva, Istanbul, London Heathrow, Madrid, Manchester, Milan, Moscow, Munich, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Rome, Zurich Asia: Ahmedabad, Baku, Bangkok, Bengaluru, Chennai, Colombo, Delhi, Hyderabad, Islamabad, Jakarta, Karachi, Kochi, Kolkata, Kozhikode, Kuala Lumpur, Lahore, Male, Manila, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Thiruvananthapuram, Tokyo Australasia: Melbourne, Sydney North America: Chicago, New York JFK, Toronto, Washington, D.C.\\nEtihad Wellness\\nTo protect its customers, Etihad launched 'Etihad Wellness', a comprehensive health and hygiene programme, building on the stringent measures already put in place to deal with COVID-19, and which is now a major component of the airline's long-term customer strategy. The launch of the programme was championed by the introduction of specially trained Wellness Ambassadors, a first in the industry, who provide essential travel health information and care online via webchat, at Abu Dhabi International Airport, and in-flight, so guests can fly with greater peace of mind.\\nThe global response to many aspects of the programme, including the game-changing Wellness Ambassadors and wide-ranging travel health and hygiene protocols, has been overwhelmingly positive. The airline is taking the opportunity to develop Etihad Wellness as a key differentiator for customers when purchasing a premium product which can guarantee them genuine care and effective health and safety measures, and deliver a world-leading service and hospitality offering.\\nEtihad Wellness initiatives are being communicated through an easy-to-use online guide focusing on the high standards of cleanliness, and health and hygiene being applied at every stage of the customer journey. This includes culinary hygiene at the airline's catering facilities and food testing laboratory, aircraft cabin deep-cleaning, check-in, health screening, boarding, inflight experience and product, crew interaction, arrival, and ground transportation.\\nIn June, Etihad also launched a partnership with Austria-based healthcare technology company, Medicus AI, to launch a COVID-19 risk-assessment tool that will empower guests to make informed decisions about travelling.\\nWorkforce\\nCOVID-19 has brought unprecedented challenges for all airlines, with demand for travel significantly reduced, and Etihad continues to do all it can to support its world-class family of employees during this difficult period. However, due to the severity of the situation facing the industry, the airline has been forced to redesign the organization around the need to make redundancies from its workforce across several areas of the business to ensure future continuity. Temporary company-wide salary sacrifices of 25% to 50% were also introduced.\\nMr. Douglas adds: \\\"Etihad, like all major airlines, has had no choice but to embrace the ambiguity of the situation it has been thrown into, and with much sadness, we have had to make some extremely difficult decisions to reduce the size of the workforce by several thousand. Those who have departed Etihad have done so with incredible dignity and their contribution has been immeasurable.\\n\\\"We are tremendously proud of each member of the Etihad family, every one of whom has gone above and beyond in extremely difficult conditions to keep Etihad's image held high, while maintaining superior levels of service. Etihad flew into the COVID-19 era with uncertainty but is re-emerging resilient, if a little battle-scarred, with a renewed focus on its core values. We are retraining our people throughout the organization to deliver a new product for a new reality, based on the development and delivery of Etihad Wellness well into the foreseeable future.\\\"\\nHumanitarian flights\\nEtihad and Etihad Cargo operated special humanitarian services to 60 cities around the world, 40 of which are not currently served by the airline's passenger or cargo network of flights. These included Addis Ababa, Antananarivo, Auckland, Bamako, Banjul, Barbados, Bhubaneswar, Bishkek, Bogota, Bucharest, Buenos Aires, Conakry, Dushanbe, Erbil, Freetown, Grozny, Harare, Havana, Kabul, Kiev, Kinshasa, Kish Island, Larnaca, Lima, Lucknow, Makhachkala, Moroni, N'Djamena, Niamey, Nouakchott, Podgorica, San Jose, Santiago, Santo Domingo, Sofia, Tirana, Wuhan, Yerevan, and Zagreb.\\nExtensive maintenance program\\nWith most of its passenger aircraft on the ground throughout April, May and June, Etihad embarked on the biggest aircraft maintenance program in its history. The airline's MRO division, Etihad Engineering, performed maintenance work on 97 passenger aircraft including 29 Airbus A320 and A321s, 10 Airbus A380s, 39 Boeing 787s, and 19 Boeing 777-300ERs. This ranged from minor maintenance tasks, such as seat repairs and updates to inflight entertainment systems, to bringing forward scheduled engine changes and modifications on several aircraft, reducing the need to withdraw them from service when scheduled services resumed. The extensive program was additional to the routine maintenance which is carried out at regular intervals.\\nSustainability\\nEtihad continues to be a leader, together with its partners in the UAE and around the world, in pioneering new and effective ways of mitigating aviation's environmental impact. The sustainability strategy of the Etihad Aviation Group is aligned to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. In January, in the presence of the EU Commission Etihad announced our commitment of zero net carbon Emissions by 2050 and halving of 2019 emissions by 2035.\\nFollowing the launch of the Greenliner programme in partnership with Boeing in November 2019, Etihad in January took delivery of a specially branded Boeing 787-10 aircraft, wearing a special 'green' livery to highlight its role in sustainability research activities, to drive innovation and sustainability into the operational space. To celebrate Ireland's National Day, Etihad deployed the Greenliner from Abu Dhabi to Dublin. An optimised route profile reduced the journey time by 40 minutes, cut fuel by 800kgs, and CO2 by three tonnes.\\nIn the same month, when Etihad announced its sustainability commitments in Brussels, the airline operated a Boeing 787 EcoFlight from Abu Dhabi to the home of the EU. The flight had an optimised routing by Eurocontrol; minimum single use plastics; and other fuel efficiency initiatives including the use of electric tractors at the Abu Dhabi hub, reducing APU usage, and optimizing potable water levels.\\n\\\"The clear focus moving forward is on adapting our transformation plan to reflect new market conditions, but without changing our overall objectives or sustainability goals and commitments. We anticipate some continued volatility for a while to come, as the world strives to put an end to COVID-19, and as testing methodologies and protocols evolve to become the new norm.\\n\\\"We know that markets are certain to rebound and the world will rediscover the wonder of flying once more. When it does, our guests will value the Etihad Wellness proposition more than ever, and we are best positioned to deliver the security, assurance, and best-in-class experience they have come to expect from Etihad as a true full-service airline\\\", concludes Mr. Douglas.\\nhttps://www.etihad.com/en/news/etihad-airways-reports-strong-start-to-2020-with-second-quarter-heavily-impacted-by-covid-19\\nEVA Air (TPE: 2618)\\nEva Air is a subsidiary of the privately held Evergreen Group.\\nCompany History\\n2020\\nAirlineRatings.com recognized EVA the 3rd of \\\"World's Top 20 Safest Airlines\\\".   \\nEVA was recognized the 9th of \\\"World's Safest Airlines\\\" by AERO International, a magazine in Germany.   \\n2019\\nTripAdvisor recognized EVA \\\"Best Airline in Asia\\\", \\\"Best Business Class in Asia\\\", \\\"Best Premium Economy Class in Asia\\\" and 3rd of \\\"World's Best Airlines\\\".   \\nEVA recognized as \\\"The Best Business Class Onboard Amenities Kit (Georg Jensen)\\\", \\\"The Best Business Class Onboard Amenities Kit (Salvatore Ferragamo)\\\", \\\"The Best Premium Economy Class Onboard Amenities Kit (Sport b.)\\\", \\\"The Best Economy Class Onboard Textiles\\\" by Onboard Hospitality, a transportation magazine of U.K. PAX International, a Canadian professional aviation magazine, awarded EVA \\\"Asia Best Economy Class Amenity Kit (Sport b.)\\\".

Finnair also offers package tours under its Aurinkomatkat-Suntours and Finnair Holidays brands.\\nFinnair's vision is to shape the wonders of travel with passengers. Finnair's mission is to inspire passengers to effortlessly connect and experience the world in a more sustainable way. Helsinki's geographical location gives Finnair a competitive advantage since the fastest connections between many European destinations and Asian megacities fly over Finland.\\nFinnair has a stable position in the domestic market and it is poised to benefit from expected growth in Asian markets. Finnair aims to deliver value to its shareholders by focusing on its core business and businesses close to it, and by investing in its competitiveness and growth.\\nFinnair has a clear strategy for reaching its goals. The foundation for the strategy is seen in the high quality of its operations, Helsinki's favorable geographic position, growing focus markets, clear goals to increase revenue, modern fuel-efficient fleet as well as a strong balance sheet.\\nFinnair is listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki Mid Cap list.\\nSustainable profitable growth\\nFollowing a period of accelerated growth, Finnair is now moving into a new phase. The company seeks to grow in line with the market, targeting sustainable and profitable growth.\\nFinnair's Board of Directors has defined the following targets for the 2020-2025 strategy period:\\nComparable EBIT of over 7.5% over the cycle (at constant fuel and currency)   \\nROCE of over 10% over the cycle (at constant fuel and currency)   \\nOn-time-performance of over 85%   \\nImproved Net Promoter Score and improved employee Net promoter score   \\nCarbon neutrality by the end of 2045 and a 50 per cent net carbon reduction by the end of 2025 compared to the 2019 level   \\nFinnair aims to deliver these targets through a focused strategy that leverages the geographical advantage of Finnair's hub in connecting Europe and Asia. Due to the COVID-19-pandemic, Finnair is assessing its financial targets and the schedule for reaching them, taking into account the assumption of the company's management that the traffic is expected to recover in 2-3 years on the 2019 level. The financial targets, the timing for their implementation, or both may be amended depending on the length and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nAdditional guidance for the 2020-2025 strategy period includes the following indicative items:\\nCapacity growth, measured in Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) of 3-5% CAGR   \\nOptimize liquidity, yet keeping cash to sales ratio above 15%   \\nGearing ratio 175% at maximum   \\nAssess renewal and downsizing of the hybrid bond   \\nIncrease the share of owned aircraft vs. leased aircraft   \\nKeep the dividend policy unchanged   \\nDividend policy\\nThe aim of Finnair's dividend policy is to pay, on average, at least one-third of the earnings per share as a dividend during an economic cycle. The aim is to take into account the company's earnings trend and outlook, financial situation and capital needs in the distribution of dividends.\\nhttps://investors.finnair.com/en/finnair-as-an-investment?_ga=2.145176692.1596177746.1590133959-941304950.1590133959\\n27 April 2023\\nFinnair Group Interim Report 1 January - 31 March 2023\\nStrong demand and well-progressed strategy implementation led to break-even result during seasonally weakest quarter.\\nJanuary - March 2023\\nEarnings per share were -0.01 euros (-0.15)*.   \\nRevenue increased by 73.8% to 694.7 million euros (399.8).   \\nComparable operating result was 0.9 million euros (-132.9).

They are part of the Group's liquidity management.\\nCEO Topi Manner\\nThe year started on a positive note, as Finnair achieved a marginally positive comparable operating result in the seasonally weakest first quarter. This was the third consecutive profitable quarter after ten loss-making quarters caused by the pandemic and the closure of Russian airspace. Typically, the first quarter of the year is loss-making and, thus, the result speaks of both good progress in strategy implementation, and of a strong demand environment. Strong demand, combined with capacity and resource constraints in the aviation sector caused by the pandemic, contributed to the positive development of our unit revenues.\\nWe are heading in the right direction, but the road to recovery is a long one. We cannot expect that the current strong demand situation is a permanent one. Our operating environment remains challenging in many respects, as the fuel price has remained high, inflation has not subsided, interest rates have risen, and the Russian airspace remains closed as the war in Ukraine continues. Therefore, we are determined to continue implementing our strategy, seeking both an increase in unit revenue, and a reduction in unit costs, in order to be able to achieve our financial targets in a normalised demand and capacity environment.\\nFinnair now has a more geographically balanced network. Although the closure of Russian airspace has reduced traffic to Asia and travel to China is only starting to increase, Finnair's position in traffic between Europe and Asia has remained strong. At the same time, we have found new passenger flows in long-distance traffic, for example, in traffic between the United States and Europe, India and the United States, and the Middle East and Northern Europe. Brisk travel within Europe has also continued. Leisure travel has returned to the pre-pandemic level, and the recovery of business travel continues.\\nDuring the quarter, we signed a new agreement with our Finland-based cabin crew to support productivity enhancement and enable savings. As a result, almost 90 per cent of Finnair's personnel have agreed on savings to nurse the company back to health. We have also made changes to the service concept on our flights, reducing unit costs. As part of our sustainability work, we purchased the largest single batch of sustainable aviation fuel from Neste to date, 750 tonnes. While this represents only a small portion of our current fuel consumption, it is a meaningful step in our long-term journey to scale up sustainable aviation fuel usage.\\nOur on-time performance during the first quarter was 82 per cent. Customers have been satisfied with Finnair's service, as our net promoter score was 42. I would like to thank the entire Finnair team for their good customer care and systematic implementation of the strategy during the quarter.\\nWe are now preparing for the busy summer season. We have strengthened our resources by recruiting pilots and hiring seasonal workers for cabin service through a partner. Thanks to our strong team and well-functioning home base Helsinki Airport, we are in an excellent position to serve our customers during the upcoming peak travel season.\\nOutlook\\nGUIDANCE ISSUED ON 15 FEBRUARY 2023:\\nFinnair estimates that in 2023, it will operate an average capacity of 80-85 per cent, as measured in ASKs, compared to 2019. The capacity is impacted by the development of demand, e.g., increase in travel on Chinese routes, and potential leases of aircraft with crew to other airlines.\\nFinnair estimates that the strong demand for travel will continue in the short-term, supporting its unit revenues as in the second half of 2022, but the continuing general economic uncertainty will weaken the visibility of travel demand development during 2023. With the fading impacts of the pandemic following the opening of China, Finnair expects normal seasonality to return. Accordingly, the first quarter of the year is seasonally the weakest and results typically in negative EBIT, while the summer months are the high season in travel.\\nSignificant uncertainty in Finnair's operating environment continues, as the price of fuel is high and the length of the Russian airspace closure and the impact of inflation on demand and costs are unclear.\\nFinnair estimates that its 2023 revenue will significantly increase year-on-year, especially as the first half of 2022 was heavily burdened by both the pandemic and the closed Russian airspace. Nonetheless, the company estimates that its revenue will not yet reach the level of 2019.\\nFinnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the Q1 2023 interim report.\\nNEW GUIDANCE ON 27 April 2023:\\nFinnair reiterates its guidance, estimating that in 2023, it will operate an average capacity of 80-85 per cent, as measured in ASKs, compared to 2019. The capacity is impacted by the development of demand, e.g., increase in travel on Chinese routes, and potential leases of aircraft with crew to other airlines.\\nFinnair estimates that the strong demand for travel will continue, supporting its unit revenues, but the continuing general economic uncertainty weakens the visibility on travel demand development after the summer season 2023. The summer months are the high season in travel, whereas demand typically weakens towards the end of the year, based on normal seasonality.\\nSignificant uncertainty in Finnair's operating environment continues. The price of fuel is high, and the end of the Russian airspace closure is not in sight. Further, the extent of the impacts of inflation and rising interest rates on demand and costs is uncertain.\\nFinnair estimates that its 2023 revenue will significantly increase and comparable EBIT will significantly improve year-on-year, especially as the first half of 2022 was heavily burdened by both the pandemic and the closed Russian airspace. Nonetheless, the company estimates that its revenue and comparable EBIT will not yet reach the level of 2019.\\nFinnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the 2023 half-year report.\\nhttps://investors.finnair.com/en/financial-information/result-center\\nHawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ: HA)\\nOur history\\nHawaiian Airlines was incorporated on January 30, 1929 under the name Inter-Island Airways Ltd. That year, thousands gathered in Honolulu to witness the departure of Hawaii's first scheduled inter-island flights to Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii. The fleet was comprised of two eight-passenger Sikorsky S-38 amphibian planes; six years later, larger 16-passenger Sikorsky S-43s were added to accommodate increased traffic and newly authorized inter-island airmail service.\\nhttps://www.hawaiianairlines.com/about-us/history\\n25 April 2023\\nHawaiian Holdings Reports 2023 First Quarter Financial Results\\nHawaiian Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: HA) (the \\\"Company\\\"), parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (\\\"Hawaiian\\\"), today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2023.\\n\\\"A big mahalo to our team who continue to make us a stronger, better airline. The demand for leisure travel remains strong in the domestic markets we serve, and we see similar conditions in most of our international markets,\\\" said Hawaiian Airlines President and CEO Peter Ingram . \\\"In recent days, our team completed a significant technology initiative, one of many projects underway in 2023 that position us for a bright future. We look forward to sustaining momentum on these initiatives and returning Hawaiian to profitability.\\\"\\nStatistical data, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had:\\nUnrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion   \\n$1.6 billion in liquidity, including its undrawn $235 million revolving credit facility   \\nOutstanding debt and finance lease obligations of $1.7 billion   \\nRevenue Environment\\nHawaiian benefited from continued robust leisure demand from North America to Hawai\\u02bbi and the restoration of its international network excluding Japan . International traffic was buoyed by strong U.S. point of sale activity. Demand remained strong for premium products both domestically and internationally. The Company's overall operating revenue for the first quarter 2023 was up 28.4% from the first quarter 2022 on 15.4% higher capacity as Hawaiian recovered from the effects of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which impacted results in the first quarter 2022.\\nOther revenue was down 12.4% compared to the first quarter of 2022 driven by a decrease in cargo revenue.\\nOperational Environment\\nSeveral challenges continued to negatively affect the environment in which the Company operates. Constraints on the availability of A321 aircraft due to Pratt & Whitney engine delays, ongoing runway construction at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu (\\\"HNL\\\"), and delays related to air traffic control protocols disrupted Hawaiian's on-time performance, impaired its scheduling, and adversely affected its financial results.\\nLimitations on Hawaiian's A321 fleet availability necessitated the substitution of A330 aircraft, which are less fuel efficient, on some A321 routes. Fuel consumption for the first quarter 2023 was up 21.4% as compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to higher capacity and inefficiencies resulting from these challenges.\\nFirst Quarter 2023 Highlights\\nTechnology Advancement\\nTransitioned its Passenger Service System to Amadeus' Altea platform marking a significant information technology (\\\"IT\\\") accomplishment for the Company in April; this new platform will enable the Company to be more commercially and operationally nimble   \\nRoutes and Network\\nOperated at 115% of its 2022 first quarter capacity, comprised of 98%, 119%, and 275% capacity on its North America, Neighbor Island and International routes, respectively   \\nAnnounced an increase in summer weekly frequencies between Honolulu and Austin, Boston , Las Vegas , and Pago Pago in preparation for strong summer demand to Hawai'i as well as a fourth daily flight between Honolulu and Los Angeles twice per week   \\nAnnounced resumption of service between Honolulu and Fukuoka beginning April 28 with thrice-weekly service   \\nGuest Experience\\nStreamlined the Honolulu travel experience with the opening of a new TSA security checkpoint at HNL, which added 1,000 square feet for passenger queuing and 3,000 square feet of screening area; expanded screening capacity alleviates congestion and benefits all guests whether they are flying to a neighbor island or boarding a transpacific flight   \\nPeople\\nReceived ratification by Hawaiian's pilots represented by the Air Line Pilots Association of a four-year contract that provides for pay scale increases across all fleet types, improved health benefits, a signing bonus, and cost sharing, and enhancements to the postretirement and disability plans for more than 1,000 employees   \\nFormed a partnership with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's Aviation Maintenance Technology SkillBridge program which provides an opportunity for veterans to bridge the transition into the civilian aviation and aerospace sector   \\nEstablished a $100,000 scholarship fund in partnership with Arizona State University's W.P.

Our teams are creating opportunities and implementing initiatives to transform our business and preparing it for the future so that we emerge more competitive. This includes initiatives such as our new shorthaul operation at Gatwick, Vueling's expansion at Paris-Orly, Aer Lingus' services from Manchester to the US and the Caribbean and our new maintenance model in Barcelona.\\n\\\"We also remain resolute in our climate commitments. We're transforming our business and driving change to create a truly sustainable airline industry. IAG has led the way by being the first airline group worldwide to commit to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and we welcome IATA's recent announcement that the industry will join us in meeting this goal.\\\"\\nTrading outlook\\nAt current fuel prices and exchange rates, IAG expects its 2021 operating loss before exceptional items to be approximately \\u20ac3.0 billion. Quarter 4 capacity, measured in ASKs, is expected to be approximately 60% of 2019, resulting in 2021 capacity of 37% of the 2019 level.\\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\\nALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\\nAll figures in the tables below are before exceptional items.\\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\\nCOVID-19 Summary - Nine months to September 30, 2021\\nThe Group's results continue to be impacted by COVID-19 and the related restrictions on travel. A detailed review of the impact of COVID-19 on the Group in 2020 was provided in the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts and this review provides an update for the first nine months of 2021.\\nIn the first half of 2021, due to the continuing impact of the virus worldwide and the associated travel and border restrictions applying in many countries, the Group was only able to operate a limited passenger schedule, with capacity operated only 20.8 per cent of that operated in 2019. Passenger capacity for quarter 2 was 21.9 per cent of 2019, up marginally on the 19.6 per cent operated in quarter 1, with an increase in capacity during the quarter where travel restrictions allowed. Capacity was increased to 43.4 per cent of 2019 in quarter 3, linked to a partial easing of restrictions. The Group operated 3,334 additional cargo-only flights, leading to record cargo revenue for the nine months.\\nThe Group seeks to reduce the impact of volatile commodity prices by hedging fuel purchases in advance, based on expected capacity levels. The Group also hedges foreign exchange rates. The impact of COVID-19 has led to a significant reduction in the requirement to purchase jet fuel, due to the significantly reduced flying programme. As a consequence, the Group has derivative contracts for which there was no corresponding purchase of jet fuel, leading to discontinuance of hedge accounting for these fuel derivatives, together with the related foreign exchange derivatives. In aggregate there is a net loss on these derivative contracts as, whilst the commodity fuel price has risen in recent months, the average fuel price over the period covered by these contracts was significantly below levels seen before COVID-19, when these derivative contracts were taken out. The exceptional credit in the nine months is mainly due to the reversal of prior year charges resulting from reduced losses (compared to previously forecast) on these contracts, due to rising fuel prices in 2021, net of an adjustment for the latest assessment of capacity for 2021 and foreign exchange movements.\\nIn May 2021, the Board approved a revised fuel hedging policy, which is designed to provide flexibility to respond to both significant unexpected reductions in travel demand or capacity and/or material or sudden changes in jet fuel prices. The revised policy allows for differentiation within the Group, to match the nature of each operating company, and a greater use of call options. The revised policy will operate on a two-year rolling basis, with hedging up to 60 per cent of anticipated requirements in the first twelve months and up to 30 per cent in the following twelve months and with flexibility for low-cost airlines within the Group to adopt hedging up to 75 per cent in the first twelve months. For all Group airlines, hedging between 25 and 36 months ahead will only be undertaken in exceptional circumstances.\\nThe Group continues to take action to preserve cash and boost liquidity. In the nine months the Group drew debt facilities agreed in 2020, namely a \\u00a32.0 billion Export Development Guarantee (EDG) term loan for British Airways from UK Export Finance and \\u20ac75 million for Aer Lingus from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. IAG closed a dual-tranche senior unsecured bond issuance in March, raising \\u20ac1.2 billion, with \\u20ac500 million maturing in 2025 and \\u20ac700 million maturing in 2029. In May, IAG raised \\u20ac825 million by issuing a convertible bond, maturing in 2028. During the nine months the Group also signed a committed secured Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with a syndicate of banks for $1.755 billion, available for three years, plus two consecutive one-year extension periods, at the discretion of the lenders. The facility is available to Aer Lingus, British Airways and Iberia, each of whom has a separate borrower limit within the overall facility. Any drawings under the facility would be secured against eligible unencumbered aircraft assets and take-off and landing rights at both London Heathrow and London Gatwick airports. The facility remained undrawn at the end of September. Simultaneous with entering into this new RCF, British Airways cancelled its US dollar revolving credit facility that was due to expire in June 2021 and which had $786 million undrawn and available at December 31, 2020. Approximately \\u20ac400 million of aircraft financing facilities expired undrawn by the end of March. In July funding of $785 million was secured for British Airways through a sustainability-linked Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) financing, to be drawn down against future aircraft deliveries; at September 30, 2021 $685 million remained undrawn. Total liquidity at the end of the nine months remained strong at \\u20ac10.6 billion, including cash, cash equivalents and current interest-bearing deposits of \\u20ac7.6 billion and committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities of \\u20ac3.0 billion. On November 1, 2021, the Group closed a \\u00a31 billion committed credit facility for British Airways, partially guaranteed by UK Export Finance, which remains undrawn.\\nThe Group expects that it will take until at least 2023 for passenger demand to reach the levels of 2019. As a result, the Group is actively involved in restructuring its cost base to adjust to significantly lower levels of demand, including actions to reduce fixed costs and to increase the variable proportion of the cost structure.\\nBasis of preparation\\nBased on the extensive modelling the Group has undertaken in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including considering plausible but severe downside scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity for the going concern assessment period to June 30, 2023 and accordingly the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated results for the nine months to September 30, 2021.\\nHowever, there are a number of significant factors related to the status and impact of COVID-19 worldwide that are outside of the control of the Group. These include the emergence of new variants of the virus and potential resurgence of existing strains of the virus; the availability of vaccines worldwide, together with the speed at which they are deployed; the efficacy of those vaccines; and the restrictions imposed by national governments in respect of the freedom of movement and travel. Due to the uncertainty that these factors create, the Directors are not able to provide certainty that there could not be more severe downside scenarios than those that have been considered in the modelling, including the sensitivities the Group has considered in relation to factors such as the impact on yield, capacity operated, cost mitigations achieved and the availability of aircraft financing to offset capital expenditure. In the event that such a scenario were to occur, the Group would need to implement additional mitigation measures and would likely need to secure additional funding over and above that which is contractually committed at November 4, 2021.\\nThe Group has been successful in raising liquidity in the nine months to September 30, 2021, having financed all aircraft deliveries in the period, secured an additional \\u20ac4.4 billion of non-aircraft debt, secured a new $1.755 billion Revolving Credit Facility, committed for three years and secured a $785 million aircraft-specific facility in the form of a sustainability- linked EETC financing structure. However, the Board cannot provide certainty that the Group will be able to secure additional funding, if required, in the event that a more severe downside scenario than those it has considered were to occur and accordingly this represents a material uncertainty that could cast doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\\nThe Group has continued to maintain its framework and processes to identify, assess and manage risks. The Board continues to meet frequently and review updates, including risk related, from management.\\nThe principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group, detailed on pages 78 to 88 of the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts, remain relevant. The ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (considered as an \\\"Event causing significant network disruption\\\" risk) continue to negatively impact the external risk environment for the Group and change the risk profile of a number of the Group's other principal risks. The Group continues to carefully review its principal risks, implement necessary mitigations to adapt and assess how the severity or likelihood of occurrence of certain risks has changed, which includes consideration of emerging risks related to competitive and market risk, talent and skills retention risk and the acceleration of the digital landscape and customer trends and sentiment to travel. Where further action has been required, the Board has assessed potential mitigations and, where appropriate or feasible, the Group has implemented or confirmed plans that would address those risks.\\nFrom the risks identified in the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts, the main risks that have been impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic and ongoing recovery are highlighted below. Business responses implemented by management and that effectively mitigate or reduce the risk are reflected in the Group's latest business plan and scenarios.\\nAirports, infrastructure and critical third parties. Restrictions at hubs and airports have required capacity adjustments, including fleet adjustments and new operating procedures as markets and regions re-open. The Group has pro-actively worked with suppliers across all categories to ensure that operations are maintained and the impact to their businesses understood, with mitigations implemented where necessary. Additional focus will be placed on key suppliers following the removal of governments' support schemes. Operational bottlenecks such as immigration resource at airports and the potential for Air Traffic Control (ATC) disruption next summer remain outside of the Group's control, although management continues to liaise with the relevant providers to identify potential solutions.   \\nCompetition, consolidation and government regulation. The scale of governmental support and aviation specific state-aid measures and the potential impact to the competitive landscape is under continuous assessment.   \\nData and cyber security. The Group has maintained its planned investment in cyber security. The heightened threat of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and services persists and the Group continues to focus its efforts on further mitigating cyber risks through a Group wide cyber programme.   \\nIT systems and IT infrastructure. The Group is reliant upon the resilience of its systems for key customer and business processes and is exposed to risks that relate to poor performance, obsolescence or failure of these systems. The Group is currently engaged in a number of initiatives to modernise its IT systems, whilst also delivering an ongoing efficiency programme and upgrading its digital capability, customer propositions and core IT infrastructure and network where required. Some of these initiatives have been delayed or impacted by actions the Group is taking to respond to the operational and health requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic.   \\nPeople, culture and employee relations. The Group is focussed on staff wellbeing and people morale and motivation, particularly as our people return to their offices and the Group businesses adapt and implement hybrid working models. Welfare support schemes are in place to support the Group's staff and initiatives to build trust and engagement continue across the Group's businesses. The Group has identified the skills and capabilities that are required to manage its transformation, which include enhancing its leadership capability and delivering on the Group's diversity and inclusion plans. Employee consultations linked to restructuring proposals have been undertaken as required.   \\nPolitical and economic environment. National governments continue to impose varying and complex travel and testing requirements, which will continue to impact Group operations and dampen demand as customers choose not to fly given the uncertainty around the application and cost of these. These changes are being actively monitored and near-term capacity plans are refreshed dynamically, according to the latest status. The economic impact of the pandemic, especially with the focus on potential future variants driving further uncertainty, is expected to be significant and the Group will continue to adjust its future capacity plans accordingly, retaining flexibility to adapt as required.   \\nDebt funding and financial risk. Financial markets have been volatile since the spread of the pandemic, although the Group has been able to secure new funding and facilities as needed. The Group has an established process to monitor financial and counterparty risk on an ongoing basis. The Group implemented a new fuel hedging policy during May 2021, providing greater flexibility over fuel hedging.   \\nThe Board and its sub committees have been appraised of regulatory, competitor and governmental responses on an ongoing basis.\\nOperating and market environment\\nAverage commodity fuel prices for the nine months to September 30, 2021 were approximately 40 per cent higher than the equivalent period in 2020, with prices rising since the start of 2021, in contrast to the significant fall in March 2020 as COVID-19 took hold. The US dollar weakened approximately eight per cent against the euro and nine per cent against the pound sterling compared with 2020.\\nIAG's results are impacted by exchange rates used for the translation of British Airways' and IAG Loyalty's financial results from pound sterling to the Group's reporting currency of euro. For the nine months to September 30, 2021 the net impact of translation on the operating result before exceptional items was \\u20ac15 million adverse.\\nFrom a transactional perspective, the Group's financial performance is impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily from the US dollar, euro and pound sterling. The Group normally generates a surplus in most currencies in which it does business, except for the US dollar, as capital expenditure, debt repayments and fuel purchases typically create a deficit. The Group hedges a portion of its transaction exposures. The net transaction impact on the operating result before exceptional items was favourable by \\u20ac188 million for the period, reducing revenues by \\u20ac114 million and reducing costs by \\u20ac302 million.\\nThe net impact of translation and transaction exchange on the operating result before exceptional items for the nine months was \\u20ac173 million favourable.\\nCapacity\\nIn the nine months to September 30, 2021, IAG capacity, measured in available seat kilometres (ASKs), was lower by 18.9 per cent versus 2020 and by 71.0 per cent versus 2019, with the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic felt across all regions. Q3 2021 saw the highest passenger numbers and load factors since the start of the pandemic, however capacity continues to be affected by the travel restrictions put in place by national governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and variants of the virus.\\nDuring quarter 1, British Airways capacity was adversely impacted by the UK-wide lockdown imposed at the beginning of January and associated international travel ban. Longhaul routes operated primarily for cargo purposes with daily flights to several US cities. Shorthaul operations were severely limited by restrictions, but regular operations connected the main cities and saw steady business travel demand. Iberia's longhaul operations were focussed on Latin America and the Caribbean (LACAR) and benefitted from Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) travel over the Christmas and New year period and in the lead up to Easter, although the EU restrictions introduced in response to the identification of the Brazil COVID-19 variant adversely impacted passenger numbers. Vueling operations were focussed on Domestic markets, connecting the Spanish peninsula with the Canary and Balearic Islands. Aer Lingus capacity continued to be driven by cargo needs, with flights operating regularly to New York, JFK, Chicago and Boston with very low passenger load factors. LEVEL longhaul operations out of Barcelona were very limited with only regular flights to Buenos Aires in quarter 1.\\nDuring quarter 2, British Airways capacity was impacted by the UK government's travel restrictions and the re-introduction of the traffic light travel system. The restricted nature of the 'green' list severely limited the recovery in capacity expected on the lifting of lockdown restrictions. Restrictions introduced by other governments on travellers from the UK in response to the delta COVID-19 variant also contributed to the low capacity. Iberia longhaul operations continued to focus on LACAR with routes to Colombia and Ecuador benefitting from VFR traffic. Shorthaul routes benefitted from high levels of transfer traffic in the quarter. Vueling operations in the quarter benefitted from the Spanish government lifting the state of alarm on May 9, 2021 and the associated restrictions on travel. Domestic routes connecting the Spanish peninsula with the Canary and Balearic Islands performed well. Aer Lingus capacity continued to be severely limited by the stringent restrictions put in place by the Irish government, with passenger load factors averaging only 20 per cent. Operations were driven by cargo needs, with flights operating regularly to New York, Chicago and Boston. LEVEL continued regular operations to Buenos Aires and towards the end of the quarter restarted flights to San Francisco.\\nDuring quarter 3, British Airways capacity was impacted by the UK traffic light travel system and the stringent testing requirements for travel. Longhaul routes to North America and Asia Pacific continued to be driven by cargo requirements with low passenger load factors. Leisure routes performed well in the quarter with high load factors on Caribbean routes as well as European destinations on the green and amber lists. Iberia longhaul operations continued to focus on LACAR with routes continuing to benefit from VFR traffic. Restrictions put in place by the Argentinian government limited operations, but this was offset by easing of restrictions in Brazil and Chile. Shorthaul routes benefitted from summer leisure traffic across the network. Vueling's capacity increased in the quarter and Domestic and European routes benefited from summer vacation travel. Domestic capacity recovered to above 2019 levels as routes connecting the peninsula to the Canary and Balearic Islands performed well. Aer Lingus expanded operations in quarter 3 following the Irish government's decision to ease travel restrictions for non-essential travel on July 19, 2021. Domestic capacity also increased following the transfer of a number of routes from Stobart Air following its liquidation. LEVEL restarted routes to New York and Mexico in the quarter, however overall capacity was impacted by strict restrictions put in place by the Argentinian government on routes operating to Buenos Aires.\\nUnit measures have been rendered much less meaningful than usual by the significant reduction in capacity operated but are included in the commentary below for completeness.\\nRevenue\\nPassenger revenue for the nine months to September 30, 2021 fell 35.0 per cent from the previous year; in 2020 the impact of COVID-19 was mainly limited to the period from March onwards. Passenger unit revenue (passenger revenue per ASK) for the nine months decreased 20.6 per cent at constant currency ('ccy'), due primarily to lower passenger seat factors, together with lower passenger yields (passenger revenue per revenue passenger kilometre), associated with the impact of COVID-19.\\nCargo revenue for the nine months was 28.0 per cent higher versus 2020 and up 31.7 per cent at constant currency. The strong cargo revenue performance was due to additional cargo-driven flights; during the nine months 3,334 cargo-only flights were operated. Cargo revenue for the nine months was \\u20ac1,174 million, up from \\u20ac917 million in the previous year and total cargo carried, measured in cargo tonne kilometres (CTKs) was 15.0 per cent higher. Yields were higher versus last year reflecting the ongoing market supply and demand imbalance. During this pandemic, cargo revenue has had to cover the entire cost of operating cargo-only flights, without passenger revenue, on aircraft configured for passengers.\\nOther revenue fell by 20.1 per cent and by 15.7 per cent at ccy, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 on the Group's non- airline businesses.\\nCosts\\nEmployee costs for the nine months decreased by \\u20ac519 million compared with 2020, mainly linked to the restructuring programmes implemented in 2020. The Group continued to receive assistance from temporary furlough and equivalent temporary cost reduction schemes, which in the nine months amounted to \\u20ac481 million, compared with \\u20ac414 million in the same period in 2020.\\nFuel costs, including an exceptional credit related to overhedging of \\u20ac153 million in 2021 and an exceptional charge of\\n\\u20ac1,599 million related to overhedging in 2020, reduced by 68.0 per cent. Excluding the exceptional overhedging credit in the period and the overhedging charge in 2020, fuel costs reduced by 28.6 per cent.\\nSupplier costs decreased by 27.7 per cent, linked to volume-related savings due to the lower capacity operated, together with a reduction in non-essential expenditure and negotiated savings as a result of COVID-19.\\nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment costs, including an exceptional impairment credit of \\u20ac13 million in 2021 and an exceptional impairment charge in 2020 of \\u20ac716 million, decreased by 40.7 per cent on the previous year, linked to the reduction in the Group's fleet triggered by COVID-19 and the related impairment charge. Excluding the exceptional impairment credit in 2021 and exceptional impairment charge in 2020, Depreciation, amortisation and impairment costs decreased by 13.7 per cent. The in-service fleet, which includes those aircraft temporarily grounded due to COVID-19, reduced from 542 aircraft at September 2020 to 533 aircraft at September 2021.\\nTotal non-fuel costs were down 30.9 per cent on the previous year and down 29.5 per cent at ccy. Excluding the impact of exceptional charges in 2020, mainly relating to fleet and related asset impairments, and exceptional credits related to the reversal of impairments in respect of four aircraft in 2021, non-fuel costs were down 21.3 per cent and down 19.7 per cent at ccy.\\nOperating loss\\nThe Group's reported operating loss for the nine months to September 30, 2021 was \\u20ac2,487 million (2020 restated: operating loss of \\u20ac5,975 million). The operating loss excluding exceptional credits in 2021 and exceptional charges in 2020, which are outlined in the Reconciliation of Alternative Performance Measures, was \\u20ac2,665 million for the nine months to September 30, 2021, compared with a restated operating loss of \\u20ac3,220 million in 2020. In 2020 the impact of COVID-19 was experienced mainly from March onwards; by contrast all nine months of 2021 were significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and the related travel restrictions.\\nNet non-operating costs, taxation and loss after tax\\nThe tax credit on the result after exceptional items for the nine months to September 30, 2021 was \\u20ac428 million (2020:\\n\\u20ac638 million), and the effective tax rate was 14 per cent (2020: 10 per cent). The substantial majority of the Group's activities are taxed where the main operations are based, UK, Spain and Ireland, with corporation tax rates during 2021 of 19 per cent, 25 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively, these result in an expected effective tax rate of 20 per cent. The difference between the actual effective tax rate of 14 per cent and the expected effective tax rate of 20 per cent is primarily due to certain current and prior period losses in Iberia and Vueling not being recognised and the effect of the rate change in the UK.\\nOn March 3, 2021 the UK Chancellor announced that legislation would be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to set the main rate of corporation tax at 25 per cent from April 2023. On May 24, 2021 the increase in the rate of corporation tax in the UK was substantially enacted, which has led to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances at September 30, 2021 and will increase the Group's future current tax charge accordingly.\\nOn October 8, 2021 the Irish government announced that it would increase the rate of corporation tax for certain multinational businesses to 15 per cent with effect from 2023. This expected tax rate change has not been reflected in these results because it has not yet been substantively enacted.\\nThe loss after tax and exceptional items for the nine months was \\u20ac2,622 million (2020 restated: loss after tax \\u20ac5,576 million), driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the Group's operating results.\\nCash and leverage\\nThe Group's cash position (including cash, cash equivalents and current interest-bearing deposits) at September 30, 2021 of \\u20ac7,619 million was \\u20ac1,702 million higher than December 31, 2020, driven by the additional liquidity actions taken in the nine months. Net debt at the end of the period was \\u20ac12,356 million compared with \\u20ac9,762 million at December 31, 2020.\\nOther recent developments\\nOn October 27, 2021 Iberia submitted remedies to the European Commission as part of the Commission's ongoing review of the proposed acquisition of Air Europa by Iberia.\\nOn November 1, 2021, the Group closed a \\u00a31.0 billion committed, five-year, credit facility for British Airways. The facility is provided by a syndicate of relationship banks and is partially guaranteed by UK Export Finance. The facility is unsecured and remains undrawn.\\nFor the full financial report, see:   https://www.iairgroup.com/~/media/Files/I/IAG/documents/iag-q3-2021-financial-results-en.pdf\\nJapan Airlines (TSE:9201)\\nEstablished\\nThe predecessor of our current company, Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. was founded on August 1, 1951 with 100 million yen in capital and began scheduled air transportation on domestic routes independently from October of the following year.\\nBased on the Japan Airlines Act (Act No. 154 of 1953), as of October 1, 1953, the current company was established with 1 billion yen in government funding and 1 billion yen in sales, for a total of 2 billion yen in capital.\\nIn this way, the established company inherited all of the rights and obligations of the previous company and became licensed to become the nation's only scheduled international air carrier, along with its domestic routes.\\n1 August 2022\\nJAL Group Announces Consolidated Financial Results for First Quarter Ending March 31, 2023\\nThe JAL Group today announced the consolidated financial results for First Quarter Ending March,\\nPeriod April 1, 2022-June 30,2022.\\n1\\uff0e JAL Group Consolidated results\\nPassenger demand that had decreased significantly by the COVID infection was on a recovery trend again in this first quarter due to the advancement of vaccination and adjustment to a post-COVID lifestyle. International passenger demand has been gradually recovering as worldwide border restrictions eased and business travels from Japan restarted. Domestic passenger demand has been steadily recovering especially from the Tokyo metropolitan area as the state of emergency declaration and similar preventive measures were fully lifted. For cargo business, despite the Russia-Ukraine situation, disrupted ocean shipments led to strong demand for air cargo and further price increase, which resulted in our cargo business to remain very strong. During this period, fuel prices rose and the yen depreciated significantly.\\nIn the above business environment, the revenue for the first quarter were increased by 102.1% year on year to 268.8 billion yen, the operating expenses increased by 40.7% year on year to 303.0 billion yen, the loss/earning before financing and income tax (hereinafter referred as \\\"EBIT\\\") was loss of 27.5 billion yen (EBIT loss of 82.6 billion yen in the previous year). The loss attributable to owners of the parent was 19.5 billion yen (the loss attributable to owners of the parent 57.9 billion yen in the previous year). Fuel expenses for the period totaled 69.8 billion yen, increased by 162.6% from the same period last year, and actual fixed costs amounted to 120.7 billion yen.\\nInternational passenger revenue for Full-Service Carriers was 62.4billion yen (increased by 457.0% year on year), domestic passenger revenue was 88.0 billion yen (increased by 131.4% year on year), and cargo mail revenue was 65.3 billion yen (increased by 37.1% year on year).\\nDetails of the consolidated financial results are as follows (Including LCC)\\n2\\uff0e Summary of Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Cash Flow\\nEquity ratio is 39.2% for credit evaluation basis, Net D/E ratio is x0.2, keeping a healthy level.   \\nLiquidity at hand was maintained at a sufficient amount of 530.3 billion yen at the end of June, as   \\nwell as the unused credit line of 250.0 billion yen, which has been reduced because of the improvement of cash inflow.   \\nAs a result of a recovery trend in passenger demand, Operating cash flow is 78.7 billion yen of inflow and Free cash flow is 46.3 billion yen of inflow.   \\n3\\uff0e  First Quarter and recent initiatives\\n\\u3010ESG strategy\\u3011\\n- In June, our ESG initiatives and its disclosure were highly evaluated and thus JAL was selected as a constituent of two leading investment indices, \\\"the FTSE Blossom Japan Index\\\" and \\\"the FTSE Blossom Japan Sector Relative Index\\\".\\n\\u3010Full-Service Carrier business domain\\u3011\\n-On international routes, due to the easing of entry restrictions to Japan and other\\nfactors, gradual recovery of passenger demand to/from Japan. In addition, JAL steadily captured transit passenger demand travelling between Asia and North America.\\n-For domestic routes, we conducted promotional campaigns with local governments and railroad companies to stimulate Tokyo-inbound demand. Also, JAL has almost completed upgrading the main large-size fleets to A350s which enabled us to provide enough capacity to meet the recovering demand in a timely manner. Due to this, JAL were able to effectively\\ncapture the strong demand during the long-holiday season in May.\\n\\u3010LCC business domain\\u3011\\n- Our mid- and long-haul international low-cost carrier, ZIPAIR Tokyo (ZIPAIR), has been gradually recognized by leisure customers and some flights were fully booked during the peak season. Spring Japan that had become our subsidiary since June 2021, Jetstar Japan started to fly cutting-edge, fuel-efficient A321LR aircraft from July, the three low-cost carriers will continue to provide their customers with useful services and expand their business.\\n\\u3010Non-aviation business domain\\u3011\\n- JAL launched a new partnership program with one of the largest point service providers in Japan, Rakuten Point, which provided the JAL Groups'customers with much more occasions to earn and redeem JAL mileage.\\n- For JALUX that became our subsidiary last fiscal year, JAL and JALUX mutually used their respective know-how and resources to conduct joint sales of flight simulator experience as\\nwell as the development of new products.\\n4\\uff0eFuture Outlook\\nThere is no change to our current full-year forecast of this fiscal year ending March 2023 that was disclosed on May 6, 2022. As the society shifts toward a balance of social economic activities and COVID prevention, both international and domestic passenger demand have been steadily recovering. There still exists various uncertain external environments including the Russia-Ukraine situation or price hike of raw materials including fuel. However, we will strive all together to achieve our performance target of 80 billion yen in EBIT.\\n5. Dividends\\nAlthough our performance and cash flow have been steadily improving, our first quarter EBIT results was a loss of 27.5 billion yen. Thus, there is need to carefully monitor further performance. Therefore, we regret that we cannot pay the interim dividends to shareholders, but we would like to ask for their understanding in this situation. For the year-end dividends for the fiscal year ending March 2023, while we must keep a close eye on the geopolitical risk or the fuel price hike risk, we will aim for achieving our profit target and dividends payment for the fiscal year ending March 2023, unless there occur significant negative events. We will update our forecast immediately when our performance becomes foreseeable.\\nhttps://press.jal.co.jp/en/release/202208/006838.html\\nKLM (EPA:AF)\\nKLM's Company Profile\\nKLM was established on 7 October 1919, making it the world's oldest airline still operating under its original name.

Through their majority control of Hanjin KAL Corporation, the Cho family, the owner family of Hanjin Group is still the airline's largest and controlling, shareholder; Cho Won-tae (aka Walter Cho), its current Chairman and CEO, is the third generation of the family to lead the airline.\\nAbout Us\\nOn March 1, 1969, Korean Air started off as a small airline in Asia, with only eight planes. Since then, we have striven to develop new markets and improve customer service through continuous changes and investments.\\n\\\"To be a respected leader in the world airline community.\\\" This is the vision we announced in 2004 to celebrate Korean Air's 35th anniversary. Under the slogan, \\\"Excellence in Flight,\\\" we have been endeavouring to provide our customers with safer and more distinguished services than any other airline in the world.\\nIn 2019, Korean Air celebrated its 50th anniversary. With the love of our customers and trust of our nation, Korean Air has soared to greater heights as a leading global airline. We will never forget that our roots lie in the support and trust shown by our customers, who have been calling us the \\\"Wings of the People\\\" over the past half a century.\\nKorean Air is taking the next step and flying towards another 100 years. We will be reborn as the \\\"Wings of the World\\\" and contribute to creating a better society for all.\\nUnder the core values of \\\"safety\\\" and \\\"customer satisfaction,\\\" we will continue dedicating the utmost effort to establishing Korean Air, an airline everyone wants to fly with, as a respected leader in the global aviation industry.\\nhttps://www.koreanair.com/my/en/footer/about-us/who-we-are/overview/greetings\\n4 May 2022\\nKorean Air's tentative financial results for Q1 2022 (Non-consolidated)\\nKorean Air posted a revenue of KRW 2.8052 trillion (USD 2.3168 billion) and a record quarterly operating profit of KRW 788.4 billion (USD 651.1 million) in its first quarter financial results.   \\n\\u203b Previous quarterly operating profit record: Q4 2021, KRW 704.4 billion\\nRevenue from the airline's passenger flight operations in the first quarter increased by 128% year-on-year to KRW 359.8 billion. Although passenger demand remained sluggish due to the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant, demand is gradually recovering as countries ease their entry restrictions one by one. On March 21, Korea lifted the mandatory quarantine for fully vaccinated travelers, helping to boost travel demand.   \\nThe airline's cargo flight operations pulled in a revenue of KRW 2.1486 trillion in the first quarter. Uncertainties in the air cargo market persisted due to various external factors such as global supply chain bottlenecks, reduction in capacity on Europe routes and high fuel prices. Korean Air is taking preemptive measures to maintain its air cargo capacity through close management of ground handling operations and flexible network operations. The airline maximized its revenue through increasing freighter operation rates and using grounded passenger jets on cargo routes.   \\nKorean Air's passenger business is expected to quickly recover in 2022, as more countries continue to open up their borders and ease entry restrictions. The recovery of passenger demand will vary by route and region, and the airline will closely monitor and flexibly respond to the market and changing quarantine policies of its network.   \\nRecovery in global passenger demand is foreseen to gradually boost global air cargo capacity, but instability in regional air cargo markets is expected to persist due to major Chinese city lockdowns and the war in Ukraine. Korean Air will tackle such uncertainties by actively responding to market changes through flexible operations and effective management of ground handling operations.   \\nWhile the entire industry was suffering from COVID-19, Korean Air significantly improved its financial structure by reducing debt. At the end of 2019, the airline's debt ratio was 814 percent, but as of the first quarter of 2022, the number decreased by 559 percentage points to 255 percent, the lowest debt ratio since 2011, when International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were introduced. Moreover, Korean Air has secured over KRW 4 trillion worth of cash and cashable assets, enabling the airline to flexibly respond to various market uncertainties, such as increasing interest rates. Korean Air plans to maintain financial stability through profitable operations and by managing its debt ratio and liquidity.   \\nhttps://www.koreanair.com/my/en/footer/about-us/newsroom/list/220503-financial-results\\nLufthansa (DAX: LHA)\\nBusiness Activities\\nThe Lufthansa Group is an aviation group with operations worldwide. With 135,353 employees, the Lufthansa Group generated revenue of EUR 36,424m in the financial year 2019. The Lufthansa Group is composed of the segments Network Airlines, Eurowings and Aviation Services. Aviation Services comprises the segments Logistics, MRO, Catering and Additional Businesses and Group Functions. The latter also include Lufthansa AirPlus, Lufthansa Aviation Training, and the IT companies. All segments occupy a leading position in their respective markets.\\nOrganisation\\nDeutsche Lufthansa AG has the management and supervisory structures typical for companies in Germany. The Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company and defining its strategic direction. In doing so, the aim is to increase Company value sustainably. The Supervisory Board appoints, advises, and supervises the Executive Board. Deutsche Lufthansa AG is the parent company and the largest single operating company in the Lufthansa Group. The individual business segments are run as separate Group companies, with the exception of the Lufthansa Passenger Airlines. They have their own profit and operating responsibility and are monitored by their respective supervisory boards, in which members of Deutsche Lufthansa AG's Executive Board are also represented.\\nhttps://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/company/company-portrait.html\\n5 May 2022\\nLufthansa Group benefits from significant increase in demand during the first quarter of 2022 and expects record summer for holiday travel.\\nDemand increases significantly in the first quarter   \\nLufthansa Cargo again with a record result   \\nSignificantly positive Adjusted free cash flow driven by strong bookings   \\nFinancial outlook confirmed despite uncertain fuel cost outlook   \\nGroup plans to terminate stabilization measures in Switzerland in the second quarter   \\nCarsten Spohr, CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, said:\\n\\\"The world is currently witnessing the importance of understanding and collaboration among people. Aviation makes an important contribution to this - it strengthens the exchange between people. We continue on our mission to connect people, cultures and economies in a sustainable way.\\nThe restrictions on air traffic have largely been overcome. We are now mentally ticking off the crisis and once again leading the way - more focused, more efficient and more sustainable than before the pandemic. The past few weeks in particular have clearly shown how great people's desire to travel is. New bookings are increasing from week to week - among business travelers, but especially for vacation and leisure travel.\\nSupply chains around the world are still disrupted while demand for freight capacity remains high. This makes our strategic decision to further strengthen Lufthansa Cargo even more valuable.\\\"\\nFirst Quarter Results 2022\\nThe Lufthansa Group recovered from the spread of the Omicron variant over the course of the first quarter of 2022. After the beginning of the year was still burdened by high infection rates especially in the Group's home markets, customer demand started to recover strongly, especially in March. In addition to high touristic demand, the business travel segment also recorded an increasing recovery.\\nCompared to the previous year, the Group more than doubled its revenue to 5.4 billion euros (previous year: 2.6 billion euros). Adjusted EBIT amounted to\\n591 million euros and thereby also improved noticeably compared to the prior year quarter, despite the effects of the pandemic (previous year:   \\n1.0 billion euros). The Adjusted EBIT margin increased accordingly to   \\n11.0 percent (previous year: -40.9 percent). Net income of -584 million euros also improved compared to the same quarter in the prior year (previous year: -1.0 billion euros).   \\nGroup airlines quadruple passenger numbers\\nThe number of passengers on board the Group airlines more than quadrupled in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Between January and March, the airlines of the Lufthansa Group welcomed 13 million passengers on board (previous year: 3 million).\\nAs a result of the strong increase in demand for air travel during the first quarter, the available capacity was also significantly increased towards the end of the quarter. Between January and March 2022, passenger airline capacity averaged 57 percent of the pre-crisis level (171 percent up on the previous year).\\nThe Adjusted EBIT of the passenger airlines amounted to -1.1 billion euros (previous year: -1.4 billion euros). The result was burdened by low seat load factors especially at the beginning of the quarter, rising fuel costs and the non-recurrence of short-time work subsidies in the prior year. However, yields were close to pre-crisis levels. On long-haul, yields even exceeded the 2019 level.\\nLufthansa Cargo strength continues, Lufthansa Technik achieves clearly positive result\\nThe positive earnings development in the logistics business segment continued in the first quarter of 2022. Cargo capacities worldwide continue to be limited by the lack of belly capacity in passenger aircraft and disruption in global supply chains, while demand remains high. This benefited Lufthansa Cargo which again achieved a record result. Adjusted EBIT rose by 57 percent in the first quarter to 495 million euros (previous year: 315 million euros).\\nThe business of Lufthansa Technik continued to recover in the first quarter of 2022. Demand for maintenance and repair services increased as airlines worldwide prepare for further market recovery in the coming months. Lufthansa Technik achieved a positive Adjusted EBIT of 120 million euros in the first quarter of 2022 (previous year: 45 million euros). The business unit thus improved its earnings by 167 percent.\\nThe LSG Group's result was down on the previous year with an Adjusted EBIT of -14 million euros (previous year: -8 million euros) due to the absence of government support measures in the USA. Without this effect, the result would have improved.\\nStrong free cash flow, liquidity continues to increase\\nIn the course of the first quarter of 2022, the number of bookings increased sharply - especially towards the end of the quarter. Many people booked their long-awaited Easter and summer holidays during this time. Driven by the high level of incoming bookings, adjusted free cash flow was clearly positive at 780 million euros (previous year: -953 million euros). As a consequence, net debt declined to 8.3 billion euros at March 31, 2022 (Dec 31, 2021: 9.0 billion\\neuros).\\nAt the end of March 2022, the company's available liquidity amounted to 9.9 billion euros. Thereby, liquidity continues to exceed the target range of 6 to 8 billion euros. This does not yet include the signing of a revolving credit facility at the beginning of April, which increases the volume of available credit lines by 1.3 billion euros. At the end of December 2021, the available liquidity of the Lufthansa Group amounted to 9.4 billion euros.\\nDue to the positive liquidity development, the company intends to terminate the stabilization measures in Switzerland ahead of schedule in the second quarter. At the end of the first quarter, SWISS had drawn down 210 million Swiss francs of the state-backed loan facility amounting to 1.5 billion Swiss francs in total. After the repayment of the drawn portion, the entire credit line shall be terminated in full.\\nRemco Steenbergen, CFO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG:\\n\\\"Demand has recovered faster and stronger than expected in recent weeks. The current level of bookings gives us confidence that our financial results will further improve in the coming quarters.\\nWe must pass through rising costs to customers. In addition, the implementation of the remaining cost reduction measures amounting to a good half billion euros will contribute to making our company as resilient as possible in the current uncertain environment.\\\"\\nOutlook\\nThe desire for people to travel is great. In recent weeks, more flight tickets were bought than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. Last week (CW17), the company sold more flight tickets in one week as in the same period in 2019. With over 120 classic holiday destinations, the airlines of the Lufthansa Group are offering more choice of tourist destinations than ever before. Destinations in the USA, South America and the Mediterranean are in particularly high demand. This summer, more people are expected to fly on holiday with the airlines of the Lufthansa Group than ever before. The volume of business travel in the Group is also expected to recover by the end of the year to around 70 percent of its pre-crisis level. Due to continued high demand in the premium segment and rising price levels, the Lufthansa Group expects an at least high-single-digit percentage rate increase of average yields in the remainder of 2022 compared to 2021. As result, yields will exceed the pre-crisis level of 2019.\\nThe company plans to offer around 75 percent of the pre-crisis capacity in the second quarter of 2022. This should significantly improve the passenger airlines' result. In the Logistics and MRO segments the positive trends of the past three months should continue.\\nFor the full year 2022, the Lufthansa Group is planning an annual average passenger airline capacity of around 75 percent. In the summer, around 95 percent of the pre-crisis capacity will be offered on European short-haul routes and around 85 percent on the Transatlantic.\\nNevertheless, uncertainties remain for the company's further business development. In view of the extreme changes in the price of kerosene in recent weeks, the development of fuel costs in particular cannot be accurately forecasted for the year as a whole. Equally, the effects of the war in Ukraine and the significant increase in inflation on consumer behavior cannot be predicted precisely. The financial forecast for the full year remains unchanged for an improvement in Adjusted EBIT compared to the previous year.\\nhttps://investor-relations.lufthansagroup.com/en/news/financial-news/investor-relations-financial-news/date/2022/05/05/lufthansa-group-benefits-from-significant-increase-in-demand-during-the-first-quarter-of-2022-and-expects-record-summer-for-holiday-travel.html\\nQantas Group (ASX: QAN)\\nAbout Qantas Group\\nQantas is the world's second oldest airline. Founded in the Queensland outback in 1920, Qantas has grown to be Australia's largest domestic and international airline. Registered originally as Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited (QANTAS), Qantas is widely regarded as the world's leading long-distance airline and one of the strongest brands in Australia.\\nWe have built a reputation for excellence in safety, operational reliability, engineering and maintenance, and customer service. In 2004, we launched Jetstar in Australia - a low-cost carrier that has since grown to six Jetstar-branded airlines operating across Asia Pacific.\\nThe Qantas Group's main business is the transportation of customers using two complementary airline brands - Qantas and Jetstar. Our airline brands operate regional, domestic and international services, and in the financial year ended June 2018 carried more than 55 million passengers.\\nThe Group's broad portfolio of subsidiary businesses ranges from Qantas Freight Enterprises to Qantas Frequent Flyer and adjacent Qantas Loyalty businesses. We also operate subsidiary businesses including other airlines, and businesses in specialist markets such as Q Catering.\\nAs at 30 June 2018, the Qantas Group employed over 30,000 people with approximately 92 per cent of them based within Australia.\\nOverview of Operations\\nThe Qantas Group consists of five operating segments, which work together as an integrated portfolio:\\nQantas Domestic is the largest carrier in the Australian domestic market, with over 40 per cent share measured by capacity. Qantas Domestic has a growing margin advantage over competitors, with a brand, network and product offering targeted at business and premium leisure customers who value the full-service experience. Qantas Domestic continues to invest in customer experience, with on-board Wi-Fi rollout underway, along with upgrades to the Domestic lounges at Brisbane and Melbourne. Along with Jetstar Domestic, the Group's dual brand strategy continues to deliver leading margins in the Australian domestic market.   \\nQantas International is the largest carrier into and out of Australia, also targeting business and premium leisure customers who value the full-service experience. With significant transformation achieved to date, Qantas International is leveraging a reshaped cost base and network as well as premier airline partnerships for growth. Along with being a founding member of the oneworld alliance or airlines, cornerstone joint ventures have been formed with Emirates, American Airlines (subject to regulatory approval), and China Eastern. Fleet changes, with the introduction of the first 787-9's in 2018 and evaluation of ultra-long range aircraft for 2022, will enable new network opportunities and cost efficiencies. As of 1H18, Qantas International included the Qantas Freight business.   \\nJetstar Group has its primary operations in Australia and New Zealand, delivering low fares and a differentiated product offering to the price-sensitive market. At the same time as Jetstar continues to expand on domestic and international routes in Australia and New Zealand, joint ventures in the fast-growing Asian markets of Singapore, Japan and Vietnam are building a pan-Asian network and brand presence   \\nQantas Loyalty is comprised of Australia's leading consumer and SME coalition loyalty programs - Qantas Frequent Flyer and Qantas Business Rewards. Qantas Loyalty continues to expand and diversify its portfolio by developing new revenue streams in health insurance through Qantas Assure, in credit cards with the launch of the Qantas Premier credit card, in online retailing, prepaid cash services, data analytics, employee recognition and reward schemes, and other communities that support the core coalition loyalty programs. Qantas Loyalty provides a stable, cash growth vehicle for the Group's earnings profile.   \\nhttps://investor.qantas.com/home/?page=about-the-qantas-group\\n24 February 2022\\nQANTAS GROUP POSTS HALF YEAR LOSS BUT STRENGTHENS BALANCE SHEET\\nUnderlying EBITDA loss: $(245) million.   \\nUnderlying Loss Before Tax: $(1.28) billion.   \\nStatutory Loss Before Tax: $(622) million.   \\nPositive statutory net free cash flow: $552 million, supported by Mascot land sale and strong Qantas Loyalty and Freight cash contribution.   \\nNet debt declined to $5.5 billion; within target range.   \\nTotal liquidity of $4.3 billion.   \\nFlying performance significantly impacted by lockdowns, ramp-up costs.   \\nApproximately $(650) million negative impacts from Omicron in 2H22.   \\nRecovery program on track to deliver >$900 million in annualised cost benefits by end FY22 (ahead of schedule).   \\nRecovery and retention plan for employees, including 1,000 share rights for approximately 20,000 employees.   \\nThe impact of Delta lockdowns and emergence of the Omicron strain drove the Qantas Group to its fourth consecutive half yearly statutory loss of the pandemic, but with some tailwinds accelerating balance sheet repair.\\nThe Group's flying operations were severely impacted by widespread domestic lockdowns and continued international restrictions, reducing the Group's total flying to 18 per cent of pre-COVID levels during the half.\\nAs a result of these severely depressed market conditions and ramp-up costs, the Group recorded an Underlying EBITDA loss of $245 million for the first half of FY22. Underlying EBIT loss was $1.13 billion, reflecting non-cash depreciation and amortisation. Revenue losses since the start of the pandemic grew to more than $22 billion.\\nHowever, cash generated from the sale of under-utilised land at Mascot; a rush of flight bookings as the Delta lockdowns ended; international border closures easing in the second quarter; and strong contributions from Qantas Freight and Qantas Loyalty made significant inroads to balance sheet repair. Net debt finished the half at $5.5 billion, putting it within the Group's target range.\\nIn a sign of the post-Delta recovery, the Group recorded three consecutive months of positive net free cash flow between October and December (excluding the land sale), largely as a result of the recovery in forward bookings.\\nThe quick ramp-up of key international services, plus the addition of new routes across Jetstar and Qantas, was key to seizing early momentum in travel demand as restrictions eased.\\nLiquidity remained strong with $4.3 billion in cash and undrawn facilities as at 31 December.\\nConcern regarding the Omicron strain had a dampening impact on travel demand in December that intensified in January and was compounded by the unexpected delay to Western Australia's border opening. However, forward demand for both international and domestic services has improved during February - helped by Australia's full reopening to all visa holders and the announcement of a new date for WA's borders to open. This positive momentum is expected to continue in coming months.\\nThe slow recovery in travel demand exacerbated stranded labour costs associated with the decision to stand up all Australian-based employees in December. This resulted in a temporary surplus of around 17 per cent of the Group's workforce in quarter three.\\nGROUP DOMESTIC\\nDelta-related lockdowns meant that domestic travel demand was heavily subdued for most of the first half, with the Group only flying 42 per cent of its pre-COVID capacity. While there was a positive demand spike in November and December, the traditional summer peak was below expectations due to Omicron- related uncertainty.\\nGroup Domestic operations recorded an Underlying EBITDA loss of $388 million.\\nWith the 15 new routes launched in the six months to December 31, Qantas and Jetstar have now announced 48 new domestic routes in the past 18 months as Australians look for new opportunities to travel.\\nCareful management of capacity meant that 92 per cent of the Group's domestic flying in the half was cash positive.\\nAlmost half of the $840 million in structural recovery benefits delivered so far have been in Qantas Domestic, with a final target of approximately $500 million per annum in savings by the end of FY23 - resulting in a significantly lower cost base compared with pre-COVID that will assist with recovery in a competitive market.\\nWithin the period, the Group announced the Airbus A320neo and A220 families as the preferred aircraft for Project Winton, its domestic fleet renewal program. The decision is still subject to final Board approval and discussions with work groups on the arrangements required to operate the aircraft, with an order anticipated by the end of FY22.\\nGROUP INTERNATIONAL AND FREIGHT\\nA record performance by Freight offset cash losses from Qantas International as it emerged from hibernation, with the whole division achieving positive Underlying EBITDA of $89 million. Depreciation and amortisation took this to an Underlying EBIT loss of $238 million.\\nThe standout result by Qantas Freight highlights the natural hedge it has provided during the pandemic due to a lack of cargo capacity on passenger aircraft.\\nWhile some of this demand will ease beyond FY22 as international passenger flights increase, there has been a permanent shift in e-commerce patterns and freight operations are expected to remain higher than pre-COVID levels. In response, Qantas announced the conversion of two A330 passenger aircraft into freighters to support this market shift as well as taking delivery of its third A321 freighter.\\nQantas was able to ramp-up quickly to take advantage of accelerated international border openings in November, with high levels of pent-up demand captured on new services to Delhi and the return of services to London, Los Angeles and Singapore.\\nDespite these bright spots, international flying remained significantly impacted by the continued closure of Australia's international border to tourists throughout the half, and the reintroduction of border restrictions by other countries as they managed Omicron.\\nQantas International has achieved approximately $325 million in recurring structural cost benefits and is on track to increase this to greater than $400 million by FY23, which will significantly assist in recovery.\\nJetstar had limited opportunities to fly internationally due to continued border restrictions across its key markets in South East Asia. Jetstar Japan narrowed its losses as domestic flying in that market started to recover.\\nQANTAS LOYALTY\\nQantas Loyalty remains a strong performer with continued earnings growth in the first half of FY22 delivering a strong cash contribution and an Underlying EBIT of $127 million.\\nThe number of Frequent Flyer members continued to grow (up 150,000 to 13.8 million) as did the number of points earned on the ground. All five major financial services partners have been re-signed as well as key supermarket partner, Woolworths. New and expanded deals were signed with Optus, Accor and bp, creating more opportunities for members to earn and redeem points.\\nIn a continued expansion into financial services, Qantas Business Money will launch in 4Q22, enabling small to medium enterprises to transact in foreign currencies at highly competitive rates and earn points in the process, in a partnership with Airwallex.\\nA combination of border openings and increase in seats available to Frequent Flyer members by up to 50 per cent saw some record levels of redemption. The program also maintained record levels of member satisfaction in the half.\\nQantas Loyalty announced a new Green Frequent Flyer tier, aimed at rewarding members for making eco- friendly decisions on the ground as well as in the air.\\nSUSTAINABILITY UPDATE\\nSustainability is a key priority for the Group as it emerges from the pandemic. Significant work took place in the half on the pathway to reach net zero emissions by 2050. In a first for any Australian airline, Qantas purchased up to 30 million litres of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) over three years for flights departing Heathrow, London.\\nIn March, the Group will announce more detail on its sustainability strategy, including an emissions reduction target for 2030.\\nLOOKING AFTER CUSTOMERS\\nUncertainty around border restrictions and testing requirements has been a significant challenge for customers as travel resumes. Recent initiatives to help include:\\nFly Well - continued investment in technology to increase contactless and self-service options at airports; social distancing as lounges have re-opened; enhanced cleaning onboard.   \\nCOVID help hub - guiding customers through every step of their journey from destination-specific information at the time of booking, to reminders and tailored messages as they get ready to fly.   \\nFly Flexible - unlimited date changes on all Qantas domestic and international fares extended through to April 2022.   \\nExtension of flight vouchers - extended credit vouchers to enable travel until 31 December 2023, with Jetstar doing the same for vouchers issued due to COVID-19 disruptions.   \\nCOVID insurance - offering peace of mind with COVID-specific travel insurance.   \\nVaccine recognition program - over 700,000 customers received Qantas Points, status credits and flight vouchers in recognition of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19   \\nREWARDING EMPLOYEES\\nAs the Qantas Group recovers from the pandemic, it's important that employees who help deliver that recovery share in the success.\\nOur people have faced unprecedented challenge and uncertainty over the past two years, enduring long periods of stand downs as well as wage freezes as the Group battled to remain viable and moved to repair the damage done by COVID.\\nThe Board today confirmed that a Recovery and Retention Plan - which was first flagged in September 2021 - will reward around 20,000 eligible non-executive employees with rights to 1,000 Qantas shares.\\nAt the current share price, the rights for each eligible employee are valued at more than $5,000. As the Group recovers, these rights allow us to reward our employees in line with shareholders.\\nThe rights are subject to conditions including the Group delivering on the key targets of its COVID recovery plan and the employee remaining with the company. If conditions are met, the rights will convert to shares in August 2023. These will be new shares issued by Qantas to employees.\\nNo annual executive bonuses will be paid in FY22 for the third year in a row and in addition to a two year wage freeze. However, managers and senior executives will be eligible for a share rights-based Recovery and Retention bonus in August 2023 based on the same performance and service conditions as non- executive employees. Formal invitations to participate in this plan will be issued in coming months and will be accompanied by relevant ASX disclosures.\\nCEO COMMENTS\\nQantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said: \\\"Most of Australia was in lockdown for several months of the first half, so the loss we've announced today isn't surprising but it is frustrating.\\n\\\"We saw a sharp rebound in travel demand when borders started opening in November and December, only to be hit by the Omicron wave and all the uncertainty that came with it.\\n\\\"The uncertainty carried over into January but demand has started to recover as Australia adjusts to truly living with COVID. Our frequent flyer surveys show the intent to travel is extremely high and we're seeing good leisure demand into the fourth quarter. We've also seen a sharp uptick in international ticket sales in the past few weeks.\\n\\\"Predictions in a pandemic are naturally fraught, so we always forecast according to the best information we have but with the agility to adjust as needed. The fact we have all our Australian-based employees back at work means it makes sense for us to fly where it's cash positive to do so.\\n\\\"Despite all the uncertainty, we finished the first half with net debt back inside our target range and with strong liquidity, meaning we can start to look further ahead at strategic decisions on fleet, network and growth opportunities.\\n\\\"We're on track to deliver more than $900 million in annualised savings through restructuring by the end of FY22, which is ahead of schedule and means we're able to recover faster and perform better than a pre- COVID Qantas Group could have.\\n\\\"The challenge of COVID hasn't obscured the challenge of sustainability and emissions. Since January, we've been adding sustainable aviation fuel into our flights from London and we're on the cusp of doing the same out of the US. We'll have a significant update on our plans for emissions reduction next month.\\n\\\"We're very conscious of the support and patience shown by customers and shareholders as we all wait for travel conditions to stabilise. In the meantime, we've done a lot of work to put this company in the best possible position to deliver.\\n\\\"Employees across the Qantas Group have lived through enormous challenge and uncertainty over the past two years. Many have been stood down for extended periods of time and we've asked them to accept a wage freeze to help our company get through an unprecedented crisis that many other airlines didn't survive.\\n\\\"I'm pleased that we're able to offer our people a direct stake in the national carrier through a reward and retention program. It means those who help us through the recovery can share in the success, just as they have in the past.\\\"\\nOUTLOOK\\nWhile travel demand is strengthening and there have been positive developments on international borders in recent weeks, Omicron is likely to negatively impact Group EBIT by an estimated $650 million in 2H22.\\nKey assumptions for FY22 are:\\nGroup Domestic capacity expected to be 68 per cent of pre-COVID levels in 3Q22, increasing to 90- 100 per cent in 4Q22.   \\nGroup International capacity expected to be 22 per cent of pre-COVID levels in 3Q22, increasing to 44 per cent in 4Q22.   \\nNet capital expenditure (excluding land proceeds) in FY22 is expected to be $850 million.   \\nUnderlying depreciation and amortisation in FY22 is expected to be $1.8 billion.   \\nRecovery and restructuring program expected to achieve greater than $900 million in annualised benefits by FY22.   \\nNet debt expected to be within target range by end of FY22.   \\nLeisure travel will continue to lead domestic recovery, with good demand expected into 4Q22.   \\nCorporate travel demand outlook remains unchanged. Recovery delayed due to Omicron and now expected to commence with return to office activities in key states from March 2022.   \\nhttps://investor.qantas.com/FormBuilder/_Resource/_module/doLLG5ufYkCyEPjF1tpgyw/file/2022HY/1H22-Media-Release.pdf\\nQatar Airways\\nAbout Qatar Airways\\nQatar Airways is proud to be one of the youngest global airlines to serve all six continents, and thanks to our customers' response to our offerings, we are also the world's fastest-growing airline.

Carrying 149m guests p.a. (pre Covid-19) on more than 2,100 daily flights from 74 bases, the Group connects over 240 destinations in 40 countries on a fleet of 470 aircraft, with a further 210 Boeing 737s on order, which will enable the Ryanair Group to lower fares and grow traffic to 200m p.a. over the next 5 or 6 years. Ryanair has a team of over 16,000 highly skilled aviation professionals delivering Europe's No.1 on-time performance, and an industry leading 35-year safety record. Ryanair is Europe's cleanest greenest airline group and customers switching to fly Ryanair can reduce their CO\\u2082 emissions by up to 50% compared to the other Big 4 EU major airlines.\\nhttps://corporate.ryanair.com/ryanair-facts-and-figures/\\n25 July 2022\\nRYANAIR REPORTS Q1 PAT OF \\u20ac170M AS TRAFFIC RECOVERS STRONGLY POST-COVID BUT AT LOWER FARES\\nRyanair Holdings today (25 July) reported a Q1 PAT of \\u20ac170m (pre-exceptional), compared to a prior year Q1 loss of \\u20ac273m, but well below the \\u20ac243m PAT reported in Q1 FY20 (pre-Covid).\\nDuring this quarter;\\nQ1 traffic recovered strongly to 45.5m from 8.1m (+9% ahead of pre-Covid).   \\nEaster bookings & fares badly damaged by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Feb.   \\nSustainalytics1 ranked Ryanair the No.1 EU airline & No.2 World airline for ESG.   \\n73 B737-8200 \\\"Gamechangers\\\" delivered ahead of peak S.22.   \\nS.22 capacity on sale at 115% of S.19 (pre-Covid) levels.   \\nFY24 fuel hedging increased to 30% (FY23: 80%).   \\nNet debt reduced to \\u20ac0.4bn at 30 Jun. (31 Mar.: \\u20ac1.45bn).   \\nMajority of A320 leases now extended by up to 4 years to 2028.   \\nRyanair's Michael O'Leary, said:\\nENVIRONMENT:\\n\\\"Ryanair puts sustainability at the heart of our growth. This summer we are operating 73 new B737 \\\"Gamechanger\\\" aircraft, delivering 4% more seats yet burning 16% less fuel and cutting noise emissions by up to 40%. Passengers flying across Europe who switch to Ryanair (from high-fare legacy airlines) can reduce their environmental footprint by up to 50% per flight, proving that with Ryanair, growth can be coupled with more sustainability, leading to a better future for all our guests and their families.\\nWe continue to work hard to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). We are investing in our partnership with Trinity College Dublin's Sustainable Aviation Research Centre, and in April we announced a partnership with Neste to power up to one third of all our flights from Schiphol Airport (AMS) with a 40% SAF blend. Ryanair hopes to power 12.5% of our flights using SAF and cut our CO\\u2082 per pax/km by 10% to 60 grams by 2030. We are working with A4E, and the EU, to accelerate reform of the Single European Sky to improve ATC efficiency and reduce flight delays, which will substantially reduce fuel consumption, CO\\u2082 emissions and flight delays.\\nIn April, Sustainalytics ranked Ryanair the No.1 airline in Europe (No.2 globally) for ESG performance. Building on this achievement, in June we submitted Ryanair's commitment letter to SBTi2 and will work with them over the next 2 years to verify our ambitious targets. Today, we launch our updated (2022) \\\"Aviation with Purpose\\\" sustainability report highlighting ambitious environmental and social targets over the coming years and mapping out Ryanair's path to net carbon zero by 2050.\\nSOCIAL:\\nOur growth plans to 2026 will see Ryanair create over 6,000 well paid jobs for highly skilled aviation professionals across Europe. Over the next 3 years, we plan to expand our state-of-the-art training centres, investing over \\u20ac100m in 2 more, high skills, training facilities (one on the Iberian Peninsula, and one in CEE). This summer we take delivery of the first of 8 new CAE full flight simulators (value over $80m). We continue to invest heavily in our engineering and maintenance teams and recently announced a new maintenance hangar facility in Malta, in addition to newly opened hangars in Kaunas (Lithuania) and Shannon (Ireland). These in- house facilities enable us to create cadet and apprenticeship opportunities for school leavers, bringing through the next generation of highly skilled aviators and aircraft maintenance professionals.\\nFollowing the beginning of the post-Covid recovery in air travel this Spring, we moved quickly with our Trade Unions to negotiate accelerated pay restoration agreements, so that we can restore previously agreed pay cuts with all our people as soon as our business returns to pre-Covid levels. To date, accelerated pay restoration agreements have been agreed with Unions representing over 80% of our pilots and approx. 70% of our cabin crews across Europe. We hope to conclude agreements with the small remaining balance in the near future. We and our Trade Union partners, are committed to completing the restoration of these agreed pay cuts, which enabled Ryanair and our Union partners to minimise job losses during the Covid-19 pandemic, at a time when our competitor airlines cut thousands of high skilled jobs.\\nIn Q1, our Customer Panel held their latest meeting at Ryanair's Lab in Madrid. Building on their feedback, Labs will introduce further service improvements over the coming months, including auto check-in and airport express to facilitate faster journeys through airports. While CSAT scores dipped this quarter, due to the impact of ongoing ATC delays on punctuality and lengthy airport security wait times, we still recorded a strong 83% rating (with crew friendliness coming in at over 90%).\\nGOVERNANCE:\\nTo facilitate orderly NED succession, Julie O'Neill will not seek re-election at the upcoming AGM and has decided to retire from the Board in Sept. Our Chairman, Stan McCarthy, Board colleagues and management thank Julie for 9 years of stellar service to Ryanair. R\\u00f3is\\u00edn Brennan will take over as Chair of Remco when Julie departs in September.\\nOP. PERFORMANCE & GROWTH:\\nOur decision to work with our unions and agree pay cuts to minimise job losses (and keep crews current) throughout the 2 years of Covid was vindicated in recent months, as many European airlines, airports, and handling companies struggled to restore jobs that were cut during the pandemic. Ryanair seems unusual among the major EU airlines in Summer 22, insofar as we are fully crewed, despite operating at 115% of our pre-Covid capacity. Our business, our schedules and our customers are being disrupted by unprecedented ATC and airport handling delays, but we remain confident that we can operate almost 100% of our scheduled flights, while minimising delays and disruptions for our guests and their families.\\nOver the past 2-years, numerous airlines went bankrupt and many legacy carriers (incl. Alitalia, TAP, SAS and LOT) only survived by significantly reducing their fleets and passenger capacity, while receiving multi-billion-euro State Aid packages. These structural capacity reductions have created enormous growth opportunities for Ryanair to deploy our new, fuel efficient, B737 Gamechangers and our market share has increased significantly across major markets in Europe. With Boeing scheduled to deliver over 50 more Gamechangers ahead of S.23, we continue to recruit and train substantial numbers of pilots, cabin crew and engineers. Approx. 50% of S.23 capacity is now on sale and we recently announced a new base in Belfast Intl. (S.23), a 4th based aircraft in Venice (W.22) and the commencement of flights from Bologna-Forli (W.22). Thanks to our 210 B737 order book, and available fleet capacity, the Ryanair Group expects to grow from 149m (pre-Covid) passengers to over 225m p.a. by FY26\\nQ1 FY23 BUSINESS REVIEW:\\nRevenue & Costs\\nQ1 scheduled revenues increased 720% to \\u20ac1.58bn. While traffic recovered strongly from 8.1m to 45.5m passengers (at a 92% load factor), Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Feb. damaged Easter bookings and fares. As such, ave. fares were down 4% on the same quarter pre-Covid. Ancillary revenue continues to perform strongly, as traffic builds, delivering over \\u20ac22.50 per passenger. Total revenues increased by 600% to \\u20ac2.6bn.\\nWhile sectors increased by almost 330% and traffic rose 460%, operating costs rose just 250% to \\u20ac2.38bn (incl. a significant 560% increase in fuel to \\u20ac1bn), driven by lower variable costs such as airport & handling, ownership & maintenance and improved fuel burn as 73 Gamechangers entered the fleet ahead of peak S.22 (offset by the higher cost of jet fuel and route charges). Lower costs, coupled with higher load factors, saw (ex-fuel) unit cost per passenger drop to \\u20ac30.\\nhedging has increased to 30% at approx. $92bbl. Carbon credits are over 90% hedged for FY23 at \\u20ac55 (well below the current spot price of c.\\u20ac90). This hedge position helps insulate Ryanair against the spiralling cost of fuel, and provides Ryanair with a significant competitive advantage, particularly into W.22.\\nFollowing a recent review of B737NG op. lease opportunities and Boeing's failure to agree competitive pricing on a new aircraft order, the Group decided instead, to extend most of our Lauda A320 leases. This process, which is close to completion, will see these leases extended by up to 4 years (until 2028), locking in material rent savings, enhance operational efficiency and facilitate growth opportunities over the coming years.\\nBalance Sheet & Liquidity\\nRyanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with a BBB (stable) credit rating (S&P and Fitch). Net debt at 30 June fell to \\u20ac0.4bn (\\u20ac1.45bn at 31 Mar.), and over 90% of the Group's fleet of B737s are unencumbered. Despite peak capex this year and next, we still expect to improve the balance sheet to a broadly zero net debt position over the next 2 years. The strength of our balance sheet ensures that the Group is well positioned to exploit the many growth opportunities that exist in a post-Covid Europe.\\nOUTLOOK:\\nWhile we remain hopeful that the high rate of vaccinations in Europe will allow the airline and tourism industry to fully recover and finally put Covid behind us, we cannot ignore the risk of new Covid variants in Autumn 2022. Our experience with Omicron last Nov., and the Ukraine invasion in Feb., shows how fragile the air travel market remains, and the strength of any recovery will be hugely dependent upon there being no adverse or unexpected developments over the remainder of FY23.\\nWhile there are clear signs of pent-up demand, bookings remain closer-in than was the norm (pre-Covid) at this time of year. We have limited visibility into the second half of Q2 and almost zero visibility into H2, when we are typically loss making. At this time, Q2 ave. fares are tracking ahead of peak S.19 (pre-Covid) levels by a low double-digit percentage. Ryanair plans to grow FY23 traffic to 165m (+11% on pre-Covid traffic) and will pursue its load active, yield passive strategy to achieve this growth. Despite being one of the best hedged airlines in Europe, high oil prices will lead to increased costs on our 20% unhedged fuel for the remainder of FY23. Given our later booking profile, the lack of visibility, volatile oil prices, potential Covid, geopolitical and supply chain risks, it is too soon to provide meaningful FY23 PAT guidance at this time. We hope to be in a better position to do so at the half year results in Nov. but, as our experience with Omicron last Nov. and Ukraine in Feb. shows, any guidance is subject to a very rapid change from unexpected events which are well beyond our control during what remains a very strong but still fragile recovery.\\\"\\nhttps://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Q1-FY23-Results.pdf\\nSingapore Airlines (SGX:C6L)\\nSingapore Airlines (SIA or SQ) is the flag carrier airline of Singapore, with its hub at Singapore Changi Airport.\\nAbout Singapore Airlines\\nFirst formed in 1972, Singapore's flag carrier airline is best known for its multiple travel accolades and impeccable service standards, embodied in its kebaya (traditional nonya dress)-clad flight attendants (famously known as the Singapore Girl).\\nStellar service is just one of a host of reasons that makes Singapore Airlines a world-class travel brand.

The airlines' international culinary panel\\u2014which comprises eight chefs from all around the globe\\u2014are constantly whipping up new dishes to delight the taste buds of passengers onboard.\\nSingapore Airlines' globally acclaimed standards have won the organisation multiple awards, ranging from a place on Time Magazine's list of 50 Genius Companies 2018 to World's Best Airline at Skytrax's World Airline Awards 2018.\\nTogether with its budget carrier arm, Scoot, Singapore Airlines operates a fleet of more than 180 aircrafts, with a combined passenger network that spans more than 135 destinations.\\nhttps://www.visitsingapore.com/en_my/travel-guide-tips/travelling-to-singapore/singapore-airlines/#:~:text=First%20formed%20in%201972%2C%20Singapore's,known%20as%20the%20Singapore%20Girl   ).\\n21 February 2023\\nSIA GROUP POSTS RECORD QUARTERLY AND NINE-MONTH PROFITS ON STRONG DEMAND\\nHighest ever quarterly operating profit, nine-month operating and net profits   \\nRecord passenger load factors for the SIA Group on robust demand across network   \\nStrong momentum in forward passenger sales for the fourth quarter   \\nWeaker global demand and increased capacity weigh on the air freight segment   \\nSIA GROUP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\\nThird Quarter FY2022/23 - Profit and Loss\\nThe Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group financial performance for the third quarter FY2022/23 is summarised as follows:\\nThe robust demand for air travel continued into the third quarter of FY2022/23, building on the momentum that began after Singapore relaxed its border restrictions in April 2022. The Group passenger capacity reached 80% of pre-Covid-191 levels in December 2022, higher than the average of 51%2 for the Asia-Pacific region. SIA and Scoot carried 7.4 million passengers in the third quarter, up 17% from the second quarter. The Group carried 18.8 million passengers during the nine months ended 31 December 2022, up nine-fold from a year before. Passenger load factors for the Group improved 0.8 percentage points to 87.4%, the highest for any quarter, on the back of record load factors for both SIA (87.3%) and Scoot (87.8%).\\nThe cargo segment's performance moderated compared to the previous quarter due to softening demand, as well as an increase in bellyhold capacity as more passenger aircraft returned to service globally. While yields were weaker quarter-on- quarter, they remained elevated - almost double - compared to pre-Covid-191 levels.\\nAs a result, Group revenue for the three months to 31 December rose $358 million (+8.0%) quarter-on-quarter to $4,846 million. This is a record quarterly revenue for the Group. Passenger flown revenue increased by $463 million (+14.0%) to $3,767 million as traffic grew 12.2% for the quarter, outpacing the 11.1% expansion in capacity. Revenue per available seat-kilometre (RASK) was 10.6 cents, the highest quarterly RASK in the Group's history. Cargo flown revenue fell $141 million (-14.1%) to $862 million, with the lower yields (-14.6%) partially mitigated by a slight uptick in loads (+0.6%).\\nExpenditure grew by $281 million (+7.4%) quarter-on-quarter to $4,091 million. This comprised a $371 million rise in non-fuel expenditure (+15.5%) that was partly offset by a $90 million decrease (-6.3%) in net fuel cost. The increase in non-fuel expenditure was higher than the increase in capacity, mainly driven by higher foreign exchange losses (+$194 million) recorded at the end of the current quarter with the US dollar weakening 6.1% against the Singapore dollar3. Net fuel cost fell to $1,333 million, mainly due to a 13% drop in fuel prices (-$226 million). This was partly offset by higher volumes uplifted (+$103 million) and lower fuel hedging gain (+$19 million).\\nThe Group posted an operating profit of $755 million for the third quarter, up $77 million (+11.4%) from the previous quarter. Operating profit for SIA was $48 million (-7.0%) lower quarter-on-quarter at $636 million. This was largely due to higher non-fuel expenditure (-$340 million), mainly driven by a foreign exchange loss in the current quarter versus foreign exchange gain in the previous quarter (-$229 million), and partly mitigated by higher operating revenue (+$182 million) as well as lower net fuel cost (+$110 million). Scoot achieved a record quarterly operating profit of $135 million, up $123 million or more than 11-fold from the previous quarter. The low-cost carrier's operating revenue surged to a record $592 million (+$145 million), significantly outpacing the increase in operating expenditure (-$22 million).\\nThe strong performance by both SIA and Scoot is a testament to the success of the Group's portfolio strategy, which enables it to effectively capture growth in different traffic segments by deploying the right vehicles to the right markets.\\nThe Group posted a net profit of $628 million, $71 million higher (+12.7%) from the previous quarter. This was due to the better operating performance (+$77 million), net interest income in the current quarter versus net finance charges in the previous quarter (+$71 million), and partially offset by a higher tax expense (-$90 million).\\nApril to December 2022 - Profit and Loss\\nRevenues rose $8,120 million (+157.9%) year-on-year to $13,263 million, the highest nine-month revenue for the SIA Group. Passenger flown revenue increased $8,160 million (+514.5%) as traffic grew seven-fold, outpacing the 108.9% expansion in capacity. RASK reached 10.1 cents (+197.1%), a record nine-month figure for the Group. Cargo flown revenue reduced $265 million (-8.2%) due to decline in cargo loads (-10.6%) while mitigated by higher yields (+2.7%).\\nExpenditure grew by $5,588 million (+98.3%) year-on-year to $11,274 million. This consisted of a $2,586 million jump (+179.2%) in net fuel cost, a $2,924 million increase (+67.7%) in non-fuel expenditure, and the absence of the $78 million gain that the Group recorded last year for fair value changes on fuel derivatives. Net fuel cost rose to $4,029 million, mainly from a 70% increase in fuel prices (+$1,866 million) and higher volumes uplifted (+$1,097 million), and partially offset by higher fuel hedging gains (-$505 million). The increase in non-fuel expenditure was lower than the increase in passenger capacity.\\nThe Group recorded an operating profit of $1,989 million for the nine months to December 2022, versus a $543 million loss a year before (+$2,532 million). Net profits rose to a record $1,555 million, reversing the $752 million loss in the previous year (+$2,307 million). This was due to the better operating performance (+$2,532 million) and lower net finance charges (+$194 million), partially offset by a tax expense versus a tax credit a year before (-$438 million).\\nBalance Sheet\\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Group shareholders' equity was $19.4 billion, a reduction of $3.0 billion from 31 March 2022 following the redemption in December 2022 of the Mandatory Convertible Bonds that were issued in June 2020. Total debt balances increased by $0.4 billion to $16.1 billion, mainly due to the increase in lease liabilities as a result of sale-and-leaseback activities. Consequently, the Group's debt- equity ratio rose from 0.70 times to 0.83 times.\\nCash and bank balances saw an increase of $1.6 billion to $15.4 billion, primarily due to net cash generated from operations including proceeds from forward sales. In addition to the cash on hand, the Group retains access to $2.2 billion of committed lines of credit, all of which remain undrawn.\\nFLEET DEVELOPMENT\\nDuring the third quarter, two Boeing 737-8 narrowbody aircraft4 joined SIA's operating fleet after their post-delivery cabin retrofit.\\nAs of 31 December 2022, SIA's operating fleet comprised 133 passenger aircraft5 and seven freighters, while Scoot had 55 passenger aircraft6 in its operating fleet. With an average age of six years and six months, the Group operates one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the airline industry7. This allows the Group to continue offering world-class products and services to customers, while pursuing operating efficiencies and significantly reducing its carbon emissions.\\nSIA is expected to take delivery of one Airbus A350-900 and one Boeing 787-10 in the fourth quarter, with the aircraft joining the operating fleet in the next financial year.\\nScoot plans to add nine new Embraer E190-E2 aircraft to its fleet, complementing its larger Airbus A320 Family and Boeing 787 aircraft. These 112-seat planes will enable Scoot to increase its network connectivity by serving thinner routes to non-metro destinations. The first aircraft is scheduled for delivery in 2024, and the remaining eight are to be progressively introduced by the end of 2025. This investment underscores the SIA Group's confidence in the growing demand for air travel in the region, and supports its wider fleet and network expansion strategy at the portfolio level.\\nNETWORK DEVELOPMENT\\nDuring the third quarter, SIA and Scoot stepped up services to meet the strong travel demand during the year-end holiday season. With the relaxation of travel restrictions to selected key markets, the Group reinstated services to destinations in China and Indonesia, and added frequencies to Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei, and points in Japan. Scoot resumed operations to Hokkaido (Sapporo), offering scheduled services via Taipei as well as direct seasonal services until February 2023. As of 31 December 2022, the Group's passenger network8 covered 111 destinations in 36 countries and territories. SIA served 76 destinations and Scoot served 57 destinations. The cargo network8 comprised 116 destinations in 38 countries and territories.\\nThe SIA Group is resuming services to China as this key market opens up to international travel. Currently, SIA and Scoot serve a total of 149 destinations in China compared to 25 points pre-pandemic.\\nDuring the current quarter, Scoot expanded its Indonesia network with the launch of flights to Balikpapan. For the Northern Summer operating season (26 March 2023 to 28 October 2023), Scoot will expand its services to China with flight resumptions to Haikou, Nanning, Ningbo, Shenyang, and Xi'an, and step up frequencies to Athens, Langkawi, Manado, Perth, Taipei-Tokyo (Narita), and Taipei-Hokkaido (Sapporo). SIA will mount supplementary flights to Barcelona, Frankfurt, and Rome during the 2023 summer peak. Services to Busan will resume in August 2023. Scoot's services to Gold Coast and SIA's services to Vancouver will be suspended with effect from July 2023 and October 2023 respectively, as the Group adjusts its capacity in response to demand.\\nGroup capacity is projected to reach an average of around 77% of pre- Covid-191 levels in the fourth quarter of FY2022/23.\\nPREPARING FOR THE FUTURE\\nSIA and Tata Sons (Tata) reached an agreement in November 2022 to merge Air India and Vistara, with SIA investing a further $360 million in Air India as part of the transaction. This transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. When completed, it will reinforce SIA's partnership with Tata and give it a 25.1% stake in the enlarged Air India group. The merged entity will be four to five times larger in scale compared to Vistara, with a strong presence in all key airline segments in India. The proposed merger will bolster SIA's presence in India, strengthen its multi-hub strategy, and allow it to continue participating directly in this large and fast-growing aviation market.\\nDeeper collaboration with like-minded airlines is an integral part of the SIA Group's partnerships strategy. This enables SIA and its partners to drive more traffic to their hubs, offer more options to customers, and increase the Group's global footprint.\\nIn November 2022, Virgin Australia resumed the sale of codeshare flights to 42 destinations in 23 countries and territories across SIA's network, enabling more seamless travel for customers between Australia, Asia, Africa, and Europe. In December 2022, Thai Airways International (THAI) and SIA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to deepen their commercial collaboration. In the initial phase, THAI and SIA will codeshare on their respective flights between Singapore and Bangkok. THAI will also put its code on SIA's flights to destinations in South Africa and the Americas in 2023, subject to regulatory approval. Earlier this month, Vietnam Airlines and SIA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen the commercial cooperation between the two airlines, including exploring codeshare arrangements between Singapore and Vietnam and potentially other destinations in the SIA network.\\nOUTLOOK\\nThe demand for air travel is expected to be robust in the fourth quarter, supported by the recovery in East Asia as travel restrictions ease across China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan. Forward sales remain strong across all markets for both leisure and business travel, as well as all cabin classes. The Group will continue to monitor the demand for air travel, and adjust its capacity accordingly.\\nDemand for air freight is expected to face headwinds, in addition to the seasonally weaker fourth quarter. This is due to macroeconomic concerns, and a slowdown in new orders as importers trim inventory levels. The increase in bellyhold cargo capacity will also increase the pressure on cargo yields.\\nThe airline industry continues to face geopolitical challenges, slowing economic growth, high cost inflation, and elevated fuel prices. Competition is likely to intensify as airlines inject more capacity on international routes. The SIA Group's robust financial position, its commitment to offer customers best-in-class products and services, as well as its enhanced agility and resilience emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic, will allow it to retain its leadership position in the industry.\\nFor the full financial report, see:   https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/Investor-Relations/Financial-Results/SGXNET/bu-q3fy2223.pdf\\nSouthwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV)\\nCompany Overview\\nIn its 50th year of service, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) continues to differentiate itself from other air carriers with exemplary Customer Service delivered by nearly 58,000 Employees to a Customer base that topped 130 million passengers in 2019. Southwest has the nation's most robust point-to-point, non-stop route network, with a strong presence in top leisure and business markets. In peak travel seasons during 2019, Southwest operated more than 4,000 weekday departures among a network of 101 destinations in the United States and 10 additional countries. In 2020, the carrier added service to Hilo, Hawaii; Cozumel, Mexico; Miami; and Palm Springs, Calif. Southwest will begin service to two new seasonal destinations in Colorado, Steamboat Springs, and Montrose (Telluride and Crested Butte) on Dec. 19, 2020. In 2021, Southwest will begin service to both Chicago (O'Hare) and Sarasota/Bradenton on Feb. 14; both Savannah/Hilton Head and Colorado Springs on March 11; Houston (Bush) on April 12; and Jackson, Miss. on June 6.\\nThe carrier has announced an intention to add service in the second quarter of 2021 in Fresno and Santa Barbara. Southwest is leveraging additional airports in or near cities where its Customer base is large, along with adding easier access to popular leisure-oriented destinations from across its domestic-focused network. Southwest coined Transference\\u00ae to describe its purposed philosophy of treating Customers honestly and fairly, and low fares actually staying low. Southwest is the only major U.S. airline to offer bags fly free\\u00ae to everyone (first and second checked pieces of luggage, size and weight limits apply, some carriers offer free checked bags on select routes or in qualified circumstances), and there are no change fees, though fare differences might apply.\\nSouthwest has a long history of returning value to its Shareholders. Since 2010, Southwest has returned more than $12.9 billion to Shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, through March 31, 2020. In first quarter 2020, Southwest returned $639 million to Shareholders through the repurchase of $451 million in common stock and the payment of $188 million in dividends.\\nDividends and share repurchase programs are currently suspended due to the negative financial effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. From its first flights on June 18, 1971, Southwest Airlines launched an era of unprecedented affordability in air travel described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as \\\"The Southwest Effect,\\\" a lowering of fares and increase in passenger traffic wherever the carrier serves. With 47 consecutive years of profitability through 2019, Southwest is one of the most honoured airlines in the world, known for a triple bottom line approach that contributes to the carrier's performance and productivity, the importance of its People and the communities they serve, and an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet.\\nhttp://www.southwestairlinesinvestorrelations.com/our-company/company-overview\\n26 January 2023\\nSouthwest Airlines Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results\\nSouthwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) (the \\\"Company\\\") today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results:\\nFourth quarter net loss of $220 million, or $0.37 loss per diluted share   \\nFourth quarter net loss, excluding special items1, of $226 million, or $0.38 loss per diluted share   \\nFull year net income of $539 million, or $0.87 per diluted share   \\nFull year net income, excluding special items, of $723 million, or $1.16 per diluted share   \\nRecord fourth quarter and full year operating revenues of $6.2 billion and $23.8 billion, respectively   \\nLiquidity2 of $13.3 billion, well in excess of debt outstanding of $8.1 billion   \\nBob Jordan, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \\\"Due to the operational disruptions in late December, which resulted in more than 16,700 flight cancellations, we incurred a fourth quarter pre-tax negative impact of approximately $800 million (or approximately $620 million on an after-tax basis), which resulted in a fourth quarter 2022 net loss. Despite the negative financial impacts in first quarter 2022 due to the Omicron variant and in fourth quarter 2022 due to the operational disruptions, we generated full year 2022 net income, excluding special items, of $723 million.\\n\\\"With regard to the operational disruptions, I am deeply sorry for the impact to our Employees and Customers. We have swiftly taken steps to bolster our operational resilience and are undergoing a detailed review of the December events. In addition, our Board of Directors has established an Operations Review Committee that is working with the Company's Management to help oversee the Company's response. As part of our efforts, we are also conducting a third-party review of the December events and are reexamining the priority of technology and other investments planned in 2023.\\n\\\"Based on current revenue and cost trends, we currently expect a first quarter 2023 net loss. However, we are encouraged by current booking trends in March 2023. Our 2023 plan continues to support solid profits with year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. We remain intent on achieving the long-term financial goals outlined at our December 2022 Investor Day. We also intend to regain our 51-year reputation for operational excellence. As ever, I am grateful for our Employees and their resilience and steadfast focus on Safety, Customer Service, and Teamwork. They remain the heart and soul of Southwest Airlines.\\\"\\nGuidance and Outlook\\nThe following tables introduce or update selected financial guidance for first quarter and full year 2023, as applicable:\\nRevenue Results and Outlook:\\nRecord fourth quarter 2022 operating revenues of $6.2 billion, a 7.7 percent increase compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nRecord full year 2022 operating revenues of $23.8 billion, a 6.2 percent increase compared with full year 2019   \\nFourth quarter 2022 operating revenues per available seat mile (RASM, or unit revenues) increased 14.9 percent driven primarily by record fourth quarter passenger yields, which increased 10.6 percent, coupled with a load factor increase of 0.4 points, all compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nFourth quarter 2022 managed business revenues were down 20 percent compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nWhile the Company's fourth quarter 2022 operating revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $410 million due to the flight cancellations in December, the Company's revenue performance leading up to the operational disruptions was strong and trending in line with previous guidance. Despite the flight cancellations, the Company had record fourth quarter operating revenues. As expected, fourth quarter 2022 managed business revenues remained below 2019 levels. The Company experienced sequential improvement from October to November, resulting in fourth quarter 2022 managed business revenues down 20 percent, compared with fourth quarter 2019, in line with previous guidance. In addition, the Company's fourth quarter 2022 operating revenues benefited from its loyalty program, including elevated point redemptions for flights and incremental revenue from its co-brand credit card agreement, as well as a continuation of increased take-rates for Upgraded Boarding following the digital self-service launch in August 2022.\\nThus far in January 2023, the Company has experienced an increase in flight cancellations and a deceleration in bookings, primarily for January and February 2023 travel, which are assumed to be associated with the operational disruptions in December 2022. As a result, the Company currently estimates a negative revenue impact in the range of $300 million to $350 million in first quarter 2023. Encouragingly, booking trends have improved sequentially this month, including notable strength in Rapid Rewards\\u00ae redemptions. Currently, March 2023 leisure booking and yield trends appear strong, and are trending in line with the Company's expectations at the time of its Investor Day in early December 2022. The recent improvements in close-in booking trends are encouraging, and the Company currently expects March 2023 managed business revenues to be roughly restored to March 2019 levels.\\nFuel Costs and Outlook:\\nFourth quarter 2022 fuel costs were $3.18 per gallon1\\u2014in line with previous guidance\\u2014and included $0.03 per gallon in premium expense and $0.35 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts   \\nFull year 2022 fuel costs were $3.07 per gallon1\\u2014in line with previous guidance\\u2014and included $0.04 per gallon in premium expense and $0.49 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts   \\nFourth quarter 2022 fuel efficiency improved 2.0 percent compared with fourth quarter 2019 due to more Boeing 737-8 aircraft, the Company's most fuel-efficient aircraft, as a percentage of its total fleet   \\nAs of January 20, 2023, the fair market value of the Company's fuel derivative contracts settling in 2023 and 2024 was an asset of $561 million   \\nThe Company's multi-year fuel hedging program continues to provide insurance against spikes in energy prices and significantly offset the market price increase, year-over-year, in jet fuel in fourth quarter and full year 2022. The Company's current fuel derivative contracts contain a combination of instruments based in West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil. The economic fuel price per gallon sensitivities3 provided in the table below assume the relationship between Brent crude oil and refined products based on market prices as of January 20, 2023.\\nNon-Fuel Costs and Outlook:\\nFourth quarter 2022 operating expenses of $6.6 billion, a 29.5 percent increase compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nFourth quarter 2022 operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profit sharing, increased 35.9 percent compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nFourth quarter 2022 CASM-X increased 44.9 percent compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nFull year 2022 CASM-X increased 22.1 percent compared with full year 2019   \\nAccrued $127 million of profit sharing expense for 2022 for the benefit of Employees   \\nThe significant increase in fourth quarter 2022 CASM-X, compared with fourth quarter 2019, was largely due to the negative financial impacts of the December 2022 operational disruptions. The Company incurred a net increase of approximately $390 million in operating expenses due to the December 2022 operational disruptions\\u2014an additional 23-point CASM-X growth headwind compared with fourth quarter 2019. The majority of the 23-point CASM-X increase was due to travel expense reimbursements to Customers and the estimated value of Rapid Rewards\\u00ae points offered as a gesture of goodwill to Customers and that are expected to be redeemed, with the remainder of the increase driven primarily by premium pay and additional compensation for Employees. Excluding the impact from the operational disruptions, the Company's fourth quarter 2022 CASM-X growth rate was trending roughly 4 points higher than the high end of its previous guidance range of up 14 percent to 18 percent, compared with fourth quarter 2019, primarily due to an increase in labor accruals for the Company's open labor contracts. The Company continues to monitor relative market compensation to evaluate its labor accruals in an effort to provide competitive market-based compensation packages for its Employees.\\nThe Company continues to experience year-over-year inflationary and other cost pressures in first quarter 2023, in particular from higher labor rates and accruals for all Employee work groups, as well as higher rate estimates for benefits and airport costs. The Company currently expects its first quarter 2023 CASM-X to increase in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent, year-over-year\\u2014approximately two points higher than its previous guidance of flat to up 2 percent, year-over year. Half of the two-point increase is attributable to a continuation of premium pay in January 2023 related to the December 2022 operational disruptions, and the remainder of the increase is primarily due to an increase in labor accruals for the Company's open labor contracts.\\nThe Company currently expects its full year 2023 CASM-X to decrease in the range of 6 percent to 8 percent, year-over-year\\u2014approximately five points lower than its previous guidance to decrease in the range of 1 percent to 3 percent, year-over-year. The vast majority of the five-point decrease in 2023 is due to the year-over-year impact from lower fourth quarter 2022 available seat miles and higher fourth quarter 2022 operating expenses than expected\\u2014both attributable to the December 2022 operational disruptions\\u2014offset slightly by an increase in 2023 labor accruals for the Company's open labor contracts. The Company plans to hire more than 7,000 new Employees, net of attrition, in 2023, a nearly 40 percent decrease from 2022 net hiring levels.\\nFourth quarter 2022 net interest expense, which is included in Other expenses, decreased $163 million, year-over-year, primarily due to a $109 million year-over-year increase in interest income driven primarily by higher interest rates, coupled with a $55 million year-over-year decrease in interest expense primarily due to various debt repurchases and repayments throughout 2022, as well as elimination of the debt discount as a result of the Company's adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, Debt\\u2014Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging\\u2014Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity.\\nCapacity, Fleet, and Capital Spending:\\nThe Company's full year 2022 capacity decreased 5.6 percent, compared with full year 2019, which was roughly one point lower than previous guidance of down 4.5 percent, due to flight cancellations from the December 2022 operational disruptions. Prior to the operational disruptions, the Company expected its 2023 capacity to increase approximately 15 percent, year-over-year. The Company's 2023 capacity growth plans currently remain unchanged. However, as a result of lower capacity in 2022, the Company's 2023 capacity is expected to increase in the range of 16 percent to 17 percent, year-over-year. As previously indicated, nearly all planned 2023 capacity additions will go to restoring the network and adding breadth and depth in existing Southwest markets.\\nThe Company received 33 Boeing 737-8 aircraft during fourth quarter 2022, including two additional -8 aircraft deliveries than previously planned, for a total of 68 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2022, compared with previous guidance of 66. The Company ended 2022 with 770 aircraft, which reflects 26 -700 aircraft retirements, including five retirements in fourth quarter. Due to Boeing's supply chain challenges and the current status of the -7 certification, the Company did not receive all 114 contractually scheduled 737 deliveries in 2022. The Company expects the remaining 46 contractual undelivered aircraft to shift into future years. Based on continued discussions with Boeing regarding the pace of expected deliveries, the Company continues to estimate it will receive approximately 100 737 aircraft deliveries in 2023, which differs from its contractual order book displayed in the table below. During first quarter 2023, the Company expects to receive approximately 30 -8 aircraft deliveries. The Company continues to expect to retire 27 -700 aircraft in 2023, including five -700 retirements in first quarter. As a result of the two additional -8 deliveries in fourth quarter 2022, the Company now expects to end 2023 with 843 aircraft, compared with its previous guidance of 841 aircraft.\\nThe Company's full year 2022 capital expenditures were $3.9 billion, relatively in line with the Company's guidance of $4.0 billion. The Company continues to estimate its 2023 capital spending to be in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion, which assumes approximately 100 737 aircraft deliveries in 2023. The Company's 2023 capital spending guidance continues to include approximately $1.2 billion in non-aircraft capital spending. Including both capital spending and operating expense budgets, the Company currently expects to spend approximately $1.3 billion in 2023 on technology investments, upgrades, and system maintenance.\\nSince the Company's previous Investor Day disclosure on December 7, 2022, the Company converted four 2023 -7 firm orders to -8 firm orders in fourth quarter 2022. Additionally, in January 2023, the Company exercised 10 -7 options for delivery in 2024.

On the 20th of May 1933, we took to the skies as State Airlines Administration. Leading the way, Turkey's first aviator and chief executive, Fesan Evrensev, set out with a mere 30 employees and 5 aircraft.\\nIn 1947, proudly flying the Turkish national flag, we conducted our first overseas flight, from Istanbul to Athens. Making headway in 1951, our fleet increased to 33 aircraft and we began to fly to new destinations: Nicosia, Beirut, and Cairo.\\nIn 1955, taking the name of Turkish Airlines, we signed a document listing our extraordinary achievements. Furthermore, our name gained its ranks alongside the members of IATA, International Air Transport Association.\\nThe construction of Istanbul Ye\\u015filk\\u00f6y Airport wrapped up in 1953 and opened to international air traffic. In 1985, it became Atat\\u00fcrk Airport, a global meeting point; a hub to thousands of memorable moments.\\nIn 1958, 5 Viscount 794 aircraft joined our fleet; After switching from piston engines to jet-powered aircraft, a new era dawned in our aviation history.\\nIn 1959, Mesut Manio\\u011flu designed our signature emblem, the wild goose, a fitting image as geese are known to fly up to an altitude of 9,000.\\nIn 1961, pilot captains Zihni Bar\\u0131n and Nurettin made another first in Turkish Airlines history by crossing the Atlantic Ocean on a F-27 aircraft on a 30-hour flight from the USA to Istanbul.\\nDue to the devoted efforts and the dedication of our workers, our capital increased from 200 million in 1972 to 400 million, an astounding 100% increase.\\nIn 1973, the first McDonnell Douglas DC-10 European aircraft was added to our fleet. A journey that began 40 years ago with 24 personnel experienced an employee network growth of 4,437.\\nThe firm belief in broadening our horizons ensured achievements that gave way to a thriving progression of our success story in the 80's. Since 1983, a fruitful 50 years, we have been bridging continents across the globe, delivering 2,5 million passengers. From Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East, we finally launched flights to America, with more than 5,000 employees on 4 continents serving our world-leading brand.\\nIn 1998, the Turkish Airlines website was launched. In 2001, we put our call centre into service. Purchasing tickets became a lot easier in 2003 with the application of e-tickets and check-in. Turkish Airlines corporate website launched with a new interface on turkishairlines.com.\\nCustomers can now view our website in English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, China and Russian amongst other languages.\\nIt currently takes less than a minute for customers to book tickets on our user-friendly mobile application that is visited by millions daily.\\nCustomer satisfaction is our top priority and we put the utmost care into ensuring that your journey runs as smoothly as possible.\\nIn 2000, we brought you Miles&Smiles, providing exclusive privileges.

Richard Branson's enthusiasm and cheeky personality reflected the airline's promise: we don't do ordinary.\\nSince then, Virgin Atlantic have become the UK's second largest carrier, helping customers to fly and connect all around the world, with non-stop transatlantic routes including New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Delhi, and Johannesburg. Plus, thanks to the joint venture with Delta, Air France, and KLM, over 350 cities across North America, Europe and the UK have now become accessible.\\nToday Virgin Atlantic's purpose is to embrace the human spirit and let it fly. This stems from our deeply rooted values - optimistic, inclusive, and adventurous. Abiding by these daily ensures we remain a 'Business for Good', helping to develop as innovators and providing customers with unique experiences.\\nTurning an ordinary like into an extraordinary love is one mission, with the other being 'Change is in the Air' - a new sustainability program, which sees Virgin Atlantic working with a number of charity partners and encouraging customers to offset their carbon.\\nhttps://www.virgin.com/virgin-companies/virgin-atlantic\\n26 March 2021\\nVirgin Atlantic Annual Report 2021\\nChairperson's statement\\n2020 was Virgin Atlantic's 36th year of continuous operation and the most difficult in the company's history. Covid-19 ruined lives and devastated economies globally. Aviation has been one of the worst affected industries, and within aviation, the long- haul sector, of which VAA is part, has been the most damaged.\\nFor more than 12 months now, we have been locked in a daily fight for survival. That we have come so far is due to the great qualities of leadership shown by our senior leadership team, led by Shai Weiss, to the unstinting and brave contributions of all our staff, and to the great support of our partners in business, who joined us in a successful and comprehensive solvent recapitalisation scheme in September last year. We are now planning on the basis of a phased exit to the pandemic in the second half of the year and a return to profitable operation in 2022.\\nThere is much to celebrate in this prospect, but this celebration has to be tempered by our sorrow and great regret for the human cost of our fight for survival. Enormously hard decisions have had to be taken to reduce operations and therefore make permanent headcount reductions, in order to survive. We are a significantly diminished team as a result. Our thoughts are with those affected, and our great thanks are due to them for their loyal service.\\nAt the end of February 2021, the UK Government published its roadmap to a progressive reopening of the economy and removal of social restrictions. This roadmap underpins our own plan to restart passenger services at scale in time for the second half of the year. However, much remains to be done in terms of planning to enable travel to resume fully. There are decisions to be taken about the requirements for Covid testing, passporting and certification.\\nVirgin Atlantic is completely focused on delivering a safe, secure and healthy environment for our staff and customers, and we have been working hard to assist Government in formulating practical and effective measures to deliver this. We will know more in April and May, after the Government's task force reports.\\nThe 2020 financial year was a story of vastly reduced flying, prodigious losses, financial restructuring to preserve liquidity, and operational restructuring to reduce our establishment in order to meet the new market environment.\\nPassenger numbers and revenue fell by 80%. We carried 1.2 million passengers compared to nearly 6 million in the previous year. Passenger revenue was \\u00a3446m compared to over \\u00a32bn in 2019. The only bright spot was the performance of our cargo operation which grew revenue by nearly 50% to \\u00a3319m, a remarkable achievement in the circumstances.\\nOur response to the crisis involved consolidating flight operations at Heathrow and Manchester, reducing our fleet and streamlining all areas of the company, which sadly also included a 41% reduction in our workforce by the end of 2020.\\nThe sudden and prolonged restrictions imposed on travel in March 2020 created enormous logistical difficulties for all passenger carriers, as literally millions of ticketed passengers sought to re-arrange or cancel flights in a short period of time, a contingency for which no operational plan existed.\\nWe ourselves refunded 220,000 bookings with more than \\u00a3600m between January and December. As was the case for all operators, we were not able to process the requests to the timescales normally in force, which we much regret.\\nHowever, we did catch up in the shortest time achievable, due to extraordinary efforts by the customer teams, and our procedures have been amended, to hopefully avoid a repetition of last year's problems.\\nThe first half of 2021 is all about the continuing fight for survival, as most long-haul routes remain closed. We continue to husband resources and to preserve cash. Following the roadmap announcement on 22 February, we look forward to a second half year of resumed operations at scale. There is even the prospect, if the roadmap timetable is adhered to, of more substantial flight operations re-starting at the end of May.\\nThe forecast that all UK adults aged over 18 will have been vaccinated by the end of July certainly underpins our optimism about reopening. Subject of course to that fundamental assumption, there are real grounds for optimism at\\nVirgin Atlantic.\\nWe have shown great agility in re-shaping the airline's operations and transforming the cost base. In 2022, we will make further progress towards our ambition to be the most loved travel company, while being sustainably profitable.\\nOn behalf of the whole Board and of our shareholders, I can safely say that the one truly bright aspect of an otherwise dreadful year in 2020 was the performance and commitment of our people. Whether in work or on furlough, all pulled together to support each other and the national effort to respond to Covid-19.\\nWe worked with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to repatriate UK citizens. We partnered with the Department of Health and the NHS to transport crucial medical supplies to the UK, including 7,000 tonnes of PPE, test kits and other medical supplies.\\nWhilst on furlough, more than 350 cabin crew volunteered to work at NHS Nightingale and other hospitals, the ambulance services and as NHS Volunteer Responders. Now, in the vaccination phase, our frontline staff with medical training are supporting the vaccine roll-out.\\nWe also owe great thanks to all our partners in business, our suppliers and our financiers. The support they have given our efforts to get through the crisis has been outstanding. At Virgin Atlantic, a core objective is to be \\\"best in partnering\\\"; I believe that the deep trust evidenced by the support of all concerned in our restructuring last September is a testament to the value of our approach to business over the years.\\n2020 was a very difficult year for very many company boards, and ours was no exception. I thank all my Board colleagues for their great contribution. I also welcome Klaus Heinemann as independent Board Observer, on behalf of our creditors. Klaus has a wealth of aviation experience, having previously served as CEO of Aercap and as Chair of Finnair. During the year, Tom Mackay, our CFO, and Ian de Sousa, our Company Secretary of more than 20 years, stepped down. We give them our great thanks and very best wishes for the future.\\nIn conclusion, on behalf of the Board and shareholders, I give our most profound thanks and appreciation to every employee of Virgin Atlantic. This has been the hardest year for very many of us and our families, and the spirit and dedication you have displayed is remarkable. Survival depended on it.\\nThrough this dark period, the contribution of the leadership team and the inspiration they have given to us all has been amazing. Shai Weiss our CEO has epitomised the Virgin ethos. He has led by example and by sheer force of character and generosity of spirit, and Shai's efforts have been matched by his colleagues in leadership. We cannot thank you all enough. Let's all look forward to better times together, Covid-19 permitting.\\nCEO Review of 2020\\nThe Covid-19 pandemic presents the biggest crisis since the Second World War, affecting public health, economies and communities globally. Aviation was one of the first industries to be affected and will be one of the last to fully recover. Despite facing the most challenging year in our 36-year history I am proud and humbled to have led Virgin Atlantic's response to the crisis.\\nSince February, we have been guided by the single mission of ensuring Virgin Atlantic's survival, so that we can continue to serve our people, customers and communities for decades to come. It was only achieved through a laser focus on reducing our costs, preserving cash and protecting as many jobs as possible.\\nUndoubtedly the airline has undergone a transformation that no one could have predicted at the beginning of the year and it has come at a huge cost to many of our people, with nearly 1 in 2 jobs lost. But as demand for travel returns, which it will, it's our greatest hope that we will be able to welcome many of our amazing former colleagues back.\\nAs we started 2020, we were on course to return to profitability, a year ahead of plan. This followed a foundational year in 2019, the first year of Velocity; a three-year plan to remove the impediments that prevented customers from flying with us and translating preference for our brand and service into purchase. Returning to profitable growth through an expanded network, improving corporate relevance and continuing to delight our customers with the best in class end to end journey experience, whilst keeping our cost discipline.\\nOur expanded joint venture with Delta and Air France KLM launched in January 2020, creating a $13bn transatlantic partnership of choice for millions of people and businesses. But as events began to unfold, on 1 February, when we took the decision to suspend our flights between London Heathrow and Shanghai, few could have predicted the scale of the global crisis that we would witness.\\nIt is worth highlighting some of the key events in 2020 which have had a lasting impact on our Company.\\nThe first business casualty of the crisis was our investment in Flybe, which entered administration on 5 March, despite the efforts of all involved to turn Europe's largest regional airline around. The impact of Covid-19 on Flybe's trading meant it was unable to secure a viable basis for its continuing operation. As a 30% shareholder in the Connect Airways consortium that acquired Flybe in January 2019, this was a devastating outcome. But with the impact of Covid-19 intensifying on airlines around the world, it was right to focus efforts on ensuring Virgin Atlantic was in the best possible position to weather the storm.\\nOn 16 March the US closed its borders to the UK, already having closed them to Schengen countries. A year later and these restrictions remain. On the same day, the UK Government advised those who could work from home to do so. With the health, safety and security of our people and customers our number one priority, a large proportion of Virgin Atlantic's workforce has operated remotely since 17 March. With our place of work a plane and our unit of time a flight, many of our front- line teams continued to travel into work including our pilots, crew, engineers and those in operational or safety critical roles.\\nOn the 23 March, the UK entered its first national lockdown, and, on the same day, we launched our first cargo only flight, bringing PPE from Shanghai, to support our NHS on the frontline. From 21 April, for a period of 90 days, Virgin Atlantic passenger flights were grounded, and our cargo operations became the primary revenue driver of the airline. The determination and resilience of our teams making this happen provided a much-needed lifeline.\\nOur vision remains to be the most loved travel company and a sustainability leader in our industry but the path to achieve it has changed. On 5 May we announced plans to reshape and resize Virgin Atlantic, including a planned reduction of 3,150 jobs across all functions.\\nWe optimised the network and simplified the fleet through the early retirement of three Airbus A340s and seven Boeing 747s. We consolidated flying at London Heathrow and Manchester, with the ambition to rebuild at Gatwick as demand returns.\\nWe announced plans for the Company to operate under a single brand, with Virgin Holidays becoming Virgin Atlantic Holidays, meaning that for the first time ever, all our revenue generating activities - airline, holidays and cargo - will be consolidated under single leadership to drive a 10x growth mindset when recovery begins.\\nOur actions in 2020 delivered more than \\u00a3300m of cost reductions and reduces our fleet capex by \\u00a3880m over the next five years, culminating in the completion of a privately funded, solvent recapitalisation of the airline on 4 September. Through a court sanctioned Restructuring Plan under the new Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 and with the unanimous support of our shareholders and creditors, we delivered a refinancing package worth \\u00a31.2bn.\\nThis included shareholder support of c.\\u00a3600m over the life of the business plan to 2025, \\u00a3170m of secured financing from Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP and more than \\u00a3450m of support and deferrals from creditors. Again, this came with a devastating impact on our people as we announced a further reduction of 1,150 jobs.\\nDuring Q3 we saw a recovery in passenger flying, with industry leading measures in place for our people and customers through our innovative Fly Safe, Fly Well programme. Despite the amazing advancements in vaccine development, following a rise in Covid-19 cases in the UK, restrictive tiers were introduced in mid-October, followed by a second national lockdown from 5 November.\\nThese were further tightened on 20 December, including a ban on non-essential travel. With tiered restrictions in force for much of the UK in Q4, our teams responded quickly, removing passenger flying and replacing it with cash contributing cargo operations.\\n2020 ended with the realization that recovery would take longer and that Virgin Atlantic, like the rest of the nation, would face further challenges through a tough winter. In December, at the same time many of us faced increased restrictions on our day to day lives, the UK approved the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/ AstraZeneca vaccines. This reignited hope of a turning point in the fight against Covid-19 as we entered 2021.\\nPerformance in 2020. A year like no other\\nWe witnessed dramatic year on year declines in key performance metrics, with revenue and passenger numbers 80% below 2019. ASKs were 73% down on 2019 - driven by the reduction in passenger flying, smaller average fleet gauge and substantial cargo only flying. As a result, sectors did not fall as materially, reducing from 23.5k to 10.6k (or 45% of 2019 levels).\\nAgility in passenger operations. Our passenger flying programme in 2020 was subject to constant change in line with ever changing global travel restrictions. Throughout 2020 we pivoted passenger flying to serve VFR (visiting friends and relatives) and leisure markets, particularly the Caribbean, India and Nigeria.\\nIn December, we launched three new services to Pakistan: London Heathrow to Lahore and Islamabad and Manchester to Islamabad. In November, we announced a new service from London Heathrow to St Vincent, launching in Summer 2021, making Virgin Atlantic the first European carrier to offer direct flights to St Vincent. With a strong heritage in premium leisure, we are well positioned to capitalize on leisure demand as travel at scale returns.\\nRecord year for cargo. Against a volatile outlook for international travel, our cargo team has delivered a record performance. Utilizing our passenger configured Boeing 787s and Airbus A350s, they operated nearly 4,000 cargos only sectors, carried more than 7,000 tonnes of PPE and delivered \\u00a3319m in revenues, a 49% increase on 2019 performance.\\nAlthough overall tonnage declined 32% from 227m in 2019 to 156m tonnes in 2020, contribution increased 148% to \\u00a3261m due to improved yield. With our Pharma Secure product launched in Q4 and our state-of-the-art purpose-built cargo facility at London Heathrow, we expect growth to continue into 2021 and eventually support global distribution of vaccines.\\nVirgin Atlantic Holidays performance mirrored the airline. With UK restrictions on non-essential retail in place for much of 2020, the Virgin Holidays retail estate has remained largely closed since March. In May 2020, 7 of the Vroom stores closed permanently. Having started the year with 55 stores, we ended the year with 50 (36 Next concessions and 14 Vrooms). Revenue declined 85% to \\u00a396m (down from \\u00a3627m), with customer numbers at 58,500, falling 85% on 2019. At a Group level, Virgin Holidays contributed \\u00a318.3m of flight revenue and \\u00a38.7m of hotel and ancillary margin.\\nOur customers. For our customers who did not take to the skies in 2020 due to cancellations caused by Covid-19, it was a challenging period and one where we did not live up to our brand promise. The huge volume of refund requests at the height of the pandemic, combined with constraints on our teams and systems during that period, lengthened our processing times. In 2020, our customer service teams dealt with more than 220,000 requests across our Airline and Holiday businesses and refunded over \\u00a3600m.\\nAccordingly, our customer satisfaction scores as measured by Net Promoter Score (NPS) reflected the measures we put in place, increasing five points on 2019 from 46 to 51. 1 In December, we were awarded 2021 APEX 5* Global airline rating for the fourth year in a row, making us the only British airline to achieved this milestone. Maintaining this rating during the most challenging year in our history is testament to the efforts of our teams on the ground and in the air, to delight our customers every single day. We are especially honoured to have been awarded the Diamond status by APEX Health & Safety powered by SimpliFlying for our comprehensive set of multi-layered measures offering the highest standards of health protection.\\nSurvival, love, profitability\\nAs global economies emerge from Covid-19, Virgin Atlantic has a vital role to play in the UK's economic recovery and a future Global Britain. Supporting vaccine distribution, global supply chains and safely flying our customers to the places they love to travel as soon as they are ready to take to the skies. The only way for Virgin Atlantic to survive 2020, was to resize and reshape so that we can emerge as a sustainably profitable airline from 2022. We went further than most. In 2021, achieving our vision to become the most loved travel company, is anchored on three critical missions: survival, love, profitability.\\nSurvival. Throughout this crisis we have been an industry first mover. The actions taken in 2020 to reduce costs, preserve cash and operate cash positive flying have given us a runway into the summer. With the earliest date for the resumption of international travel at scale now 17 May, we have taken further steps to bolster our cash position. On 15 March 2021 we agreed further financial support from our shareholders and creditors, to the tune of \\u00a3160m and we remain confident in Virgin Atlantic's survival.\\nLove. In 2021, we must get back to our best for our people and customers. Rebuilding trust and confidence in our brand and reassuring our customers to fly safe, fly well.\\nProfitability. The impact of Covid-19 on global aviation will be felt for many years to come, with demand unlikely to return to 2019 levels before 2023. Yet, for Virgin Atlantic, the outlook is transformative. A 10x mindset to revenue growth underpins our commercial plan to regrow revenues to 2019 levels by 2023.\\nPowered by technology transformation, digital first retailing and a right to win in a leisure led recovery. By 2022 we expect to fly more sectors than in 2019 with efficiencies across our fleet, network and non-fuel costs delivering more than \\u00a3200m of recurring fixed cost improvement.\\nIn February 2021 Virgin Red launched a true lifestyle loyalty programme in the UK which, alongside the strength of our transatlantic joint venture with Delta and Air-France KLM, expands our network reach and improves corporate relevance.\\nBecoming most loved\\nOur vision to become the most loved travel company comes with great responsibility and goes beyond providing best in class service to our customers. As an airline we bring huge social and economic benefits to the economies and societies we serve. The need to go further, to serve our people, the planet on which we all live and the communities in which we operate, is unabated by the pandemic.\\nOur people remain our secret sauce and the thing that sets us apart. For our crew and pilots, we have put in place an innovative holding pool structure for 1,780 colleagues. This means that as demand returns and we scale up our flying programme, we are able to welcome back as many of our people as possible. The desire to see them back with us keeps us going.\\nIn 2019, we launched our Passport to Change programme working with local schools in our community to promote studies in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM). In 2020, following events related to the WE Charity in Canada, we mutually agreed to terminate our partnership.\\nIn 2021, we will be relaunching our Passport to Change programme. With over 100 active volunteers at Virgin Atlantic and many more who have registered their interest, we know our people are passionate about improving the opportunities for all our communities.\\nIn 2020, we continued on our path to become a sustainability leader, becoming a signatory of Sustainable Aviation's commitment to Net Zero by 2050. In July we also became a member of the Jet Zero Council, a dynamic partnership between the UK Government and industry focused on developing UK capabilities to deliver net zero emission commercial flying through the acceleration of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting zero emission aircraft R&D.\\nOver the last 14 years, we have transitioned to a cleaner, greener, twin-engined fleet; reducing our CO2/RTK by 18% between 2007-2019. In 2020 we retired the last of our four- engine aircraft and our current, simplified fleet is forecast to be 10% more fuel and carbon efficient per km flown when compared to our fleet profile in 2019. In 2021, we will renew our focus and energy on industry thought leadership and innovation to achieve meaningful change in the years ahead.\\nA big red thank you\\n2020 has been a year like no other and devastating for so many. Without a doubt, it has been the toughest year in Virgin Atlantic's 36-year history. Yet, for all its hardship, 2020 has produced some exceptional moments to be proud of. In many ways we have made the impossible, possible. I have been inspired by amazing people of Virgin Atlantic. By their heroic efforts, extraordinary commitment to our survival, our customers and each other. A special thank you to my leadership team, our partners and shareholders for their unwavering belief, determination, and camaraderie.\\nOur purpose has never been more relevant - everyone can take on the world. We are facing up to the challenge, and as a team we will continue do whatever it takes to ensure our airline keeps proudly flying.\\nCFO Review of 2020\\nOur financial results for 2020 are a stark reflection of the immense challenges that the airline industry has faced from the COVID-19 pandemic. IATA predicts the airline industry to lose $118bn in 2020 with global passenger demand down by 66%. Demand across the transatlantic, which made up 70% of Virgin Atlantic's capacity in 2019, is estimated to have been down by 77%.1\\nThe year had started on plan with January and February in line with targets. From March onwards the pandemic had a dramatic impact on passenger operations. The closure of US borders combined with the UK entering its first lockdown in March led to the temporary cessation of passenger flying from 21 April to 20 July. Q2 ASKs fell to 0.2bn, a drop of 99% on the prior year. Despite passenger flying recommencing in July, ASKs for the second half of 2020 dopped by 87% vs 2019 as demand for international travel remained highly constrained due to travel and border restrictions. Full year passenger revenue fell to \\u00a3446m, 80% lower than the prior year and passenger numbers fell to 1.2m, 80% lower than the prior year.\\nDespite the challenging passenger demand environment our Cargo business thrived and played a vital role in bringing critical medical supplies to the UK. Cargo revenue grew to \\u00a3319m, up 49% on the prior year. Total revenue fell 70% on the prior year to \\u00a3868m.\\nThe scale of revenue reduction and speed at which it occurred forced an immediate shift in priority during February to preserving liquidity. Throughout the year this was achieved through: (1) Disciplined capacity management ensuring only flights contributing positively to cash were flown, (2) Reducing fixed costs and capital expenditure through taking bold and decisive actions to reshape and resize Virgin Atlantic, and (3) Reducing cash burn and raising new capital through the privately funded, solvent recapitalisation of Virgin Atlantic. Together these actions helped reduce overall costs, before exceptional items, by \\u00a31,473m to \\u00a31,382m and raise \\u00a3370m of new financing, drawn in September. The 80% reduction in passengers drove an unprecedented increase in customer refunds with more than \\u00a3600m of refunds processed during the year.\\nOverall, this resulted in an operating loss before exceptional items of \\u00a3514m, \\u00a3586m worse than 2019, and a statutory loss before tax of \\u00a3858m, \\u00a3794m worse than 2019.\\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group's financing consisted of total cash balances of \\u00a3191m (including unrestricted cash of \\u00a3115m) compared to \\u00a3449m at the end of 2019. After the year end and during Q1 2021 further financing has been secured leading to c.\\u00a3200m of additional cash support for the business throughout 2021. This comprises proceeds from a sale & leaseback in January of two Boeing 787s and further support from our largest creditors, underpinned by \\u00a397m of further shareholder support.\\nResizing and reshaping Virgin Atlantic\\nSignificant action was taken throughout 2020 to reduce the cost base and position Virgin Atlantic to become sustainably profitable once passenger demand recovers. Actions reduced operating costs by more than \\u00a3300m and include over \\u00a3200m of recurring fixed cost savings. The key actions taken comprised:\\nConsolidated network: Consolidation of flying at London Heathrow and Manchester while retaining the flexibility to restart Gatwick operations as passenger demand returns. As well as reducing costs this will improve Heathrow slot and aircraft utilisation, improving future profitability.   \\nSimplified fleet: As part of a rationalisation of the fleet we retired all our 4-engined aircraft and brought forward the retirement of an A330-200. This reduced our fleet from 45 to 37 aircraft, through the retirement of 7 Boeing 747-400s and 3 Airbus A340-600s and the arrival of 3 more fuel efficient A350-1000s. Looking forward we will operate one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient long-haul fleets in the sky.   \\nReduced headcount: Over the course of the year, we reduced our total headcount by 41% to 5,907 at year end, while retaining a holding pool structure for nearly 1,800 pilots and crew in preparation for the resumption of significant flying activity anticipated in mid-2021. Headcount reductions were felt across the company with non-customer facing and management headcount reduced by 30%.   \\nOne brand focus: The planned unification of Virgin Holidays under one master brand as Virgin Atlantic Holidays will deliver an aligned brand to customers and enabled efficiencies across marketing and operations; and   \\nCrew productivity: We negotiated ground-breaking agreements with our pilot and crew unions providing the foundation for enhanced operational stability and productivity.   \\nPrivately funded, solvent recapitalisation\\nThe completion of the privately funded, solvent recapitalisation of the airline on 4 September delivered a refinancing package worth \\u00a31.2bn with a further \\u00a3880m reduction to fleet capital expenditure. The key elements comprised:\\nShareholder support of c.\\u00a3600m over 2020-25, including a \\u00a3200m investment from Virgin Group and c.\\u00a3400m of deferred shareholder payments;   \\n\\u00a3170m of secured financing from Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, a global institutional investment management firm; and   \\nMore than \\u00a3450m of additional deferrals from our largest creditors alongside the support of our credit card acquirers (Merchant Service Providers).   \\nRefunding our customers\\nThe customer refund situation in the early summer was unprecedented, with our customer teams receiving over 10,000 queries per day, and refund requests reaching 10 times the level experienced at any time before the pandemic. Our response was to massively increase the team to over 240 people in 8 countries, as well as offer a market-leading flexibility and incentives programme, which saw over 40% of airline customers choosing to rebook on to future flights. We processed more than \\u00a3600m in cash refunds relating to over 220,000 claims.\\nFinancial results & Key metrics\\n\\u00a3m Revenue\\nEBITDA1 EBIT1 PBTEI2\\nEBIT margin (%)1\\nLoss for the year\\n2019\\n2,927\\n340\\n74\\n(22)\\n3\\n(55)\\nTotal sectors Cargo only sectors ASK (km bn) Passengers (000) Load factor (%)\\nPRASK (p)\\n23,551\\n0\\n48.83\\n5,877\\n81.1\\n4.27\\n10,601\\n3,897\\n13.04\\n1,192\\n61.1\\n3.18\\n868\\n(260)\\n(511)\\n(659)\\n(59)\\n(864)\\n2020\\nPassenger revenue\\nPassenger revenue declined 80% to \\u00a3446m from \\u00a32.2bn in the prior year, driven by passenger numbers falling 80%. The revenue decline followed the temporary cessation of passenger services on 21 April. Passenger services restarted 90 days later on 20 July, and July to October saw gradual month on month growth in passenger flying. The UK lockdown in November and tightening of travel restrictions during December saw passenger flying reduce again. Despite the reduction in passenger demand three new routes were successfully launched in December from London and Manchester to Pakistan.\\nPassenger reductions were seen across the network with UK-US routes down 83% and UK - Non-US routes down 72%. UK- Caribbean routes saw strong demand in the autumn between the periods of UK lockdown however passengers were down 70% for the full year.\\nCargo revenue\\nOur Cargo operations were the standout performer of the year, with revenues up 49% to \\u00a3319m. The revenue performance reflected a significant shortage in capacity within the global air-cargo market. As the no.2 cargo operator from London Heathrow, we were able to service a broad range of customers with scheduled cargo-only flights on key existing routes such as Shanghai, Hong Kong and our US destinations.\\nWe also added new routes including short haul destinations in Norway and Belgium. Our pharmaceutical capabilities were enhanced with the launch of Pharma Secure, a new product designed specifically to cater for the growth in vaccine distribution.\\nUnit price metrics rose on average by 130%, and freight charter flights made up 20% of our cargo operations. Although overall traffic declined 25% on the prior year due to a significant decline in belly capacity on passenger flights, traffic per sector increased significantly to 14 tonnes.\\nVirgin Holidays\\nVirgin Holidays revenue fell 85% to \\u00a396m reflecting the restrictions on non-essential travel present for much of 2020. With Holiday departures declining 80%, holiday distribution, marketing and selling costs were similarly reduced, and the operations were streamlined as part of the single brand unification programme, with Virgin Holidays due to become Virgin Atlantic Holidays. The retail store network was also reduced by 5 stores as part of the restructuring and totalled 50 stores at year end.\\nFuel costs\\nPhysical fuel costs of \\u00a3185m were down \\u00a3502m, reflecting the significant reduction in sectors flown and the retirement of our 4-engined aircraft. Throughout 2020 the operation focused on flying fuel-efficient Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 fleets to minimise fuel costs and maximise cash contribution on cargo and passenger flights.\\nA charge of \\u00a3105m relating to the closing of out-of-the-money fuel price protection hedges, put in place in 2019 to cover expected levels of 2020 flying, was partially offset by foreign exchange and unrealised fair value movements; the net \\u00a381m charge (2019: \\u00a337m credit) was recognised in exceptional items in the income statement, consistent with our usual accounting policies.\\nAircraft costs\\nAircraft and engineering costs together totalled \\u00a3258m, \\u00a391m lower than the prior year. Aircraft costs fell \\u00a315m to \\u00a3158m due to the reduction in the size of our fleet. Engineering and maintenance costs of \\u00a3100m were significantly lower than the prior year, reflecting both reduced flying hours and the retirement of the oldest aircraft in our fleet.\\nOther non-fuel costs\\nNon-fuel, non-aircraft costs of \\u00a3835m, were 54% lower than the prior year. Within this, employee remuneration of \\u00a3277m was \\u00a3145m lower than the prior year, reflecting the in-year savings from our restructuring programme which saw headcount at 31 December of 5,907 compared to 10,016 at the beginning of the year. It also reflects employee participation in the UK Government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) of \\u00a370m. The reduction in other operating and overhead costs of \\u00a3149m vs \\u00a3176m in 2019 reflect the in-year actions on our fixed costs such as indirect staff costs and volume-based reductions in operating costs.\\nFinance costs\\nNet finance costs of \\u00a3148m were \\u00a352m higher than in 2019. This was mainly driven by a \\u00a327m increase in finance lease interest and \\u00a312m increase in interest payable on external debt.\\nResult for the year\\nThe statutory loss after tax for the year was \\u00a3864m, \\u00a3809m less than 2019. EBITDA loss for the year was \\u00a3260m, \\u00a3600m lower than the prior year, and EBIT loss for the year was \\u00a3511m, \\u00a3585m below 2019.\\nThe reported Group loss before tax, equity-accounted investees, exceptional items and fair value movements totalled\\n\\u00a3659m, compared to a \\u00a322m loss in 2019, together with an exceptional charge of \\u00a3189m (2019: \\u00a332m charge). These are made up of \\u00a378m of Covid-related exceptional costs and \\u00a3111m of other exceptional costs. These include \\u00a37.8m relating to the write down of loans made early in the year to Flybe including an offset for post-administration recoveries.\\nBalance sheet, cash flow and financing\\nAdjusted balance sheet metrics\\nCash at the end of the year totaled \\u00a3191m vs \\u00a3449m in 2019, including \\u00a377m (2019: \\u00a397m) of restricted cash, but excluded \\u00a314m of unremitted cash which is recognized within our receivable's balances. The decrease reflected the significant cash outflow resulting from refunds and operating activities of \\u00a3716m, partially offset by new borrowings of \\u00a3591m. Cash from operating activities was an outflow of \\u00a3713m and was driven by the \\u00a3260m EBITDA loss and refunds.\\nNet cash used in investing activities of \\u00a323m reflects the success of the strong cash control measures put in place early in the year, together with the proceeds of the disposal of our Crawley- based facility, The Base. Within the fleet, we acquired an additional A350, while a further 2 A350s joined the fleet under leasing contracts.\\nCash inflow from actions taken in the year totaled \\u00a3456m relating principally to new borrowings of \\u00a3591m from the recapitalization programme described earlier, offset by \\u00a3100m of repayments, principally relating to aircraft leases.\\nMovements within the balance sheet principally reflect the various actions undertaken as part of our solvent recapitalization.\\nShareholder payment deferrals over the period 2020 to 2025 were recognized through a \\u00a3376m preference share issuance and are reflected in the capitalization of intangible assets relating to contracts. The increase in long term payables is also a result of revised repayment terms on contracts with both shareholders and with lessors.\\nLong-term borrowings rose as a result of the recapitalization and deferral of items previously classified as short-term borrowings, including the conversion of the existing RCF to a term loan. Deferred revenue fell, reflecting lower flying activity and reduced future bookings due to the continued uncertainty over Covid restrictions on international travel later in the year. A portion of our long-term borrowings are secured against our UK slot portfolio which had a year-end market value in excess of \\u00a3500m.\\nOutlook\\nWith the recently announced path to exit UK lockdown restrictions, there is a roadmap to recovery and to the recommencement of international passenger flying at scale. Factors such as the emergence of new variants of the Covid-19 virus and the risk of a third wave of infections continue to create significant uncertainties and Virgin Atlantic is not able to provide certainty that there will not be a more severe downside recovery scenario.\\nIn the event that such a scenario was to occur, Virgin Atlantic would need to take further actions and would likely need to secure additional funding beyond what has been achieved to date, however certainty that it will be able to achieve further funding cannot be provided. Please see note 3 'Basis of preparation' for more information.\\nWhile material uncertainties remain as to the timing and shape of recovery, the actions taken in 2020 to reshape and resize Virgin Atlantic have positioned the airline to capitalize on the recovery when it takes hold. The discipline and focus on cost and liquidity management will continue, to help ensure Virgin Atlantic's survival and return to profitability.\\nKey performance indicators\\nThe directors have outlined below the key performance indicators that they rely on to manage the business. These key metrics focus on volume, efficiency and cost performance within our business operations. The financial indicators are stated at constant currency.\\nVirgin Atlantic\\nA key volume measure used to assess volume growth and relative market share. Calculated as the total number of passengers who flew on Virgin Atlantic Aircraft.\\nAn industry standard measure of passenger carrying capacity. Calculated as the number of available seats in each flown sector multiplied by the sector distance in km.\\nAn industry measure of operational efficiency that encompasses both passenger yield and load factor performance. Calculated as the total passenger revenue divided by total ASKs.\\nA key fuel metric, Fuel CASK (p) measures our unit fuel spend and assesses our aircraft fuel efficiency and fuel hedging effectiveness. Calculated as the total fuel spend divided by total ASKs.\\nOur key volume-adjusted operational cost metric that indicates our cost control performance excluding fuel. Calculated as the total operational costs and overheads (ex-financing costs) divided by total ASKs.\\nVirgin Holidays\\nA key measure of volume and activity which drives holiday revenues. Calculated as the total number of customers served in the year, across all holiday types.\\nThis represents the operating margin achieved by the Holiday business from its travel and package holiday operations.\\nCalculated as the profit before tax and exceptional items (PBTEI) contribution.\\nVirgin Atlantic Cargo\\nUtilisation of bellyhold cargo capacity helps drive overall profitability of the airline. Calculated as the revenue generating chargeable weight carried on VA Cargo's network measured in kg\\nUsed to measure revenue performance (\\u00a3) per kilogram carried on VA Cargo's network. It's a measure of pricing execution that has a direct impact on the overall profitability of the business.\\nOur business models\\nVirgin Atlantic Limited comprises three principal lines of business: Virgin Atlantic Airlines, Virgin Atlantic Cargo and Virgin Holidays.\\nVirgin Atlantic Airlines uses a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing aircraft to carry passengers to destinations across North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia from its main bases in London and Manchester, with award winning clubhouses at 7 airports.\\nVirgin Atlantic Cargo trades and retails the belly hold capacity of Virgin Atlantic's cargo-friendly fleet, connecting manufacturers, growers, retailers and consumers across the globe. It has the ability to transport specialist and time-critical cargo ranging from the most temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals and fresh produce to a beloved family pet.\\nVirgin Holidays offers predominantly package holidays to destinations worldwide for customers principally in the UK. It has significant market positions in holidays to major US destinations including Florida and to the Eastern Caribbean. The business offers holidays through online, call centres and retail stores across the UK. Over 90% of Virgin Holidays customers also fly on Virgin Atlantic planes.\\nFor the full report, see:\\nhttps://corporate.virginatlantic.com/content/dam/corporate/Virgin%20Atlantic%20Annual%20Report%202020_final%20v1.pdf\\nVirgin Australia\\nVirgin Australia, the trading name of Virgin Australia Airlines Pty Ltd, is an Australian-based airline. On 21 April 2020, Virgin Australia Holdings went into voluntary administration, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and financial troubles in the years leading up to the pandemic. On 26 June 2020, it was announced that Bain Capital had entered into a sale and implementation deed with administrator Deloitte to acquire Virgin Australia.

As one might expect due to their central importance, the semiconductor industry is extensive and competitive. In 2021,   global semiconductor sales   reached 595 billion U.S. dollars, with the semiconductor industry predicted to grow once again in 2022 to 676 billion U.S. dollars.   Memory semiconductors   and 5G chips led semiconductor market growth in the year.\\nSemiconductor market opportunities\\nSmartphones represent an   important market for the semiconductor industry   , especially as these devices become more advanced and able to support technologies such as   XR   ,   5G   , and   AI   . Servers and data centers will become an even more important opportunity, with semiconductor innovation required to support cloud data centers and the rise in edge computing. Industrial and automotive applications are also expected to experience increased demand: as manufacturing facilities and vehicles become smarter and ever more connected, the requirement for more advanced semiconductor technology to fulfill these tasks grows.\\nSemiconductor companies\\nSome of the   biggest companies within the semiconductor industry   include integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel, Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology. The South Korean company Samsung held the greatest share of the global semiconductor market, generating more than 73 billion U.S. dollars in   semiconductor revenue   in 2021. The company overtook the previous leader, Intel, benefitting from its dominance in the memory segment of the market. Other notable firms within the global semiconductor industry include   fabless companies   like Qualcomm and Nvidia, the likes of which work closely with foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) -   the world\\\"s largest foundry   - who manufacture chips in their fabrication plants (fabs).\\nSource: statista\\nhttps://www.statista.com/topics/1182/semiconductors/#dossierKeyfigures\\nUS Semiconductor Manufacturing: Industry Trends, Global Competition, Federal Policy\\nIntroduction Semiconductors, tiny electronic devices based on silicon or germanium, provide data processing capabilities in millions of products, from coffee pots to space vehicles. The U.S. government played a significant role in the development of semiconductor technology, and domestic research and production have long been matters of intense congressional interest.\\nU.S.-headquartered semiconductor firms accounted for about half of worldwide semiconductor sales in 2015.1 However, U.S.-headquartered producers face stiff competition from firms headquartered in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan; moreover, the Chinese government has identified global leadership in semiconductors as a national priority. Further, the United States accounts for a diminishing share of global semiconductor production capacity, as manufacturers establish plants in locations where generous subsidies are available or customers in user industries, such as electronic products manufacturing, are nearby. In July 2015, Members of Congress concerned about the industry's competitiveness formed a Semiconductor Caucus to support increased federal funding for semiconductor research activities, among other objectives.\\nSemiconductor Industry Basics\\nA semiconductor chip (also known simply as a \\\"semiconductor\\\" or \\\"chip\\\") is a tiny electronic device (generally smaller than a postage stamp) comprised of billions of components that store, move, and process data. These functions are made possible by the unique properties of semiconducting materials, such as silicon and germanium, which allow for the precise control of the flow of electrical current.\\nSemiconductors are the enabling technology of the information age. Semiconductors allow computers to run software applications, such as email, Internet browsers, and word processing and spreadsheet programs and to store documents, photographs, videos, music, and other data. They also provide the \\\"brains,\\\" memory, and data communication capabilities of countless other products, from cell phones and gaming systems to aircraft and industrial machinery to military equipment and weapons. Even many products with roots in mechanical systems are now heavily dependent on chip-based electronics: one car manufacturer asserts that some of its models incorporate as many as 6,000 semiconductors. And one expert on software in cars estimates that premium-class automobiles can contain close to 100 million lines of software code (instructions) that the chips use to control the vehicle.\\nSource: Congressional Research Service\\nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44544.pdf\\nWorld Semiconductor Trade Statistics\\nThe Chapters of the four world regions appoint 13 directors who form the Board of Directors (supervision). Each region nominates a Vice Chairman who together with the Chairman forms the Executive Commitee (operational steering). The Chairman is elected by the Committee, the assembly of representatives of all member companies. WSTS has two salaried employees, the Administrator and the Assistant to Administrator.\\nThe four regions Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific have regional organizations of WSTS member companies, the so called Chapters . Chapters meet regularly and develop policies and proposals for the operation of WSTS. In addition the Chapters appoint their representatives in the Board of Directors and elect a Vice Chairman , who represents the respective region in the Executive Committee . The Chairman of the Executive Committe however is elected by the Committee, which in turn is composed of one representative of each member company. The tenure of WSTS officers is 18 month. Re-election for a second period is possible. Communication between these various functions happens by correspondence, through this Internet Portal and by meetings.\\nChapters meet two to four times a year, the Board of Directors convenes twice a year (in May and October) and the Executive Committe meets at least twice a year, too. Also the Committee has two meetings per year, normally co-timed and co-located with the venue of the Board of Directors and the Executive Commitee. Obviously the Chapter meetings take place in the respective region, whereas all other meetings with worldwide participation rotate among the regions. The currently established practice is that spring meetings alternate between Japan and Asia Pacific, whereas autumn meetings alternate between Americas and Europe. This scheme provides equitable opportunities for all Committee members to participate.\\nWSTS cooperates closely with the regional Semiconductor Industry Associations. These organizations participate as observers in all major meetings and provide an alternative feedback channel from the semiconductor industry, supplementary to the information that is brought in by the company representatives in the Committee. Semiconductor industry organizations hold also distribution licenses for WSTS reports and thereby provide a commercial distribution channel for these reports to non-semiconductor companies and organizations.\\nAs WSTS collects revenue data from competitors it is mandatory that such data is compiled and consolidated by Data Collection Agents before this data is conveyed to WSTS for the generation of statistic reports. In order to provide best protection to individual member companies' trade data, WSTS uses three Data Collection Agents, one for consolidation of Japanese member companies' data, one for consolidation of Europe member companies' data and another one who consolidates the data of all Asia Pacific and Americas companies. The latter Data Collection Agent also performs the worldwide consolidation of the data from the regions. Data Collection Agents have the typical professional qualification of certified public accountants and are service providers to both the member companies and WSTS in an arm length relationship.\\nThe WSTS employees, the Administrator and the Assistant to Administrator are responsible for the operation of all WSTS programs, for the publication of all reports and any other content of this Internet Portal, for the organization of meetings, for member services and for the financial management of the WSTS.\\nSource: World Semiconductor Trade Statistics\\nhttps://www.wsts.org/ORGANIZATION/GENERAL-PRINCIPLES\\nIntroduction to Semiconductors\\nEssence of a semiconductor\\nA semiconductor can be considered a material having a conductivity ranging between that of an insulator and a metal. A crucial property of semiconductors is the   band gap   ; a range of forbidden energies within the electronic structure of the material. Semiconductors typically have bandgaps ranging between 1 and 4 eV, whilst insulators have larger bandgaps, often greater than 5 eV [1]. The thermal energy available at room temperature, 300 K, is approximately 25 meV and is thus considerably smaller than the energy required to promote an electron across the bandgap. This means that there are a small number of carriers present at room temperature, due to the high energy tail of the Boltzmann-like thermal energy distribution. It is the ability to control the number of charge carriers that makes semiconductors of great technological importance.\\nSemiconducting materials are very sensitive to impurities in the crystal lattice as these can have a dramatic effect on the number of mobile charge carriers present. The controlled addition of these impurities is known as doping and allows the tuning of the electronic properties, an important requirement for technological applications. The properties of a pure semiconductor are called 'intrinsic', whilst those resulting from the introduction of dopants are called 'extrinsic'. This introduction of dopants results in the creation of new, intra-band, energy levels and the generation of either negative (electrons) or positive (holes) charge carriers. More detail on doping can be found on the   electronic bandstructure   webpage.\\nCrystal structure\\nClicking on a title will reveal the relevant images for that crystal structure. More information on crystallography can be found on   this page   .\\nCubic Structures\\nCubic structures have the simple property that their unit cells take the shape of a cube. There are three main variants of the cubic crystal system: the simple cubic, the bodycentered cubic (BCC) and the face-centred cubic (FCC) structures. Of greatest interest is the face-centred cubic, as several derivatives of this structure are found amongst semiconducting materials.\\nFCC structure\\nThe FCC lattice features an atom at the corners of the unit cell, in addition to one at the centre of each face. This structure is often adopted by metals as it maximises their co-ordination number.\\nDiamond structure\\nThe strong covalent bonds that carbon forms with itself result in the tetrahedrally-bonded diamond structure. Each diamond atom is bonded to four neighbours and has a co-ordination number of 8. Diamond is the prototype material, however, other Group IV elements (Si, Ge and Sn) also have this structure.\\nZincblende structure\\nAs with silicon and germanium, the III-V compound semiconductors form bonds with covalent characteristics. This results in a struture very similar to that of diamond, however, in diamond each carbon atom is bonded to another carbon atom. In the zincblende structure each atom is bonded to a different species of atom and results in a mixed lattice. The zincblende structure consists of two interpenetrating FCC lattices, where one lattice is offset by 1/4 of the unit cell. One type of atom occupies one set of lattice positions and the other species the second lattce.\\nA large number of III-V compound semiconductors adopt this structure, including AlAs, GaAs, GaP, InP and ZnSe.\\nHexagonal Structures\\nHexagonal structures have the property that they have hexagonal symmetry, with the unit cell assuming the shape of a rhombus.\\nWurtzite structure\\nMany III-V compound semiconductors can also be grown in a strucural phase known as wurtzite and is the hexagonal analogue to the zincblende structure.\\nSource:  Warwick.\\nhttps://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/current/postgraduate/regs/mpagswarwick/ex5/intro/\\nLeading Companies\\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.

In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company's use of non GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release.

These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company's core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company's earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company's core business. Management also believes that the non-GAAP liquidity measure free cash flow is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced by ADI in this release include: adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses percentage, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted nonoperating expense (income), adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and free cash flow revenue percentage.

These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about MACOM's strategic plans, priorities and long-term growth drivers, our ability to execute our long-term strategy, improve our position and drive market share gains, our ability to better address certain markets, expand our capabilities and extend our product offerings through the acquisition of Linearizer Communications Group (\\\"Linearizer Acquisition\\\"), statements about the potential market and product expansion opportunities resulting from MACOM's establishment of its European Semiconductor Center (\\\"ESC\\\"), the team's capabilities and technology and expansion thereof and any potential financial benefits derived by and financial impact to MACOM from the Linearizer Acquisition or the OMMIC SAS asset acquisition and ESC establishment, strength and competitiveness of new product introductions and technology portfolio expansion, anticipated demand for our products, MACOM's profitability, revenue targets, prospects and growth opportunities in our three primary markets, the potential impact to our business of an economic downturn or recession, anticipated financial and business improvements, the estimated financial results for our 2023 fiscal fourth quarter and the stated business outlook and future results of operations for the remainder of fiscal year 2023.\\nThese forward-looking statements reflect MACOM's current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause those events or our actual activities or results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including any failure to accurately anticipate demand for our products and effectively manage our inventory; risks related to any weakening of economic conditions; our dependence on a limited number of customers; our ability to develop new products and achieve market acceptance of those products; component shortages or other disruptions in our supply chain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical unrest or otherwise; inflationary pressures; our ability to compete effectively; and those other factors described in \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in MACOM's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\\\"SEC\\\"), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and MACOM undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\\nDiscussion Regarding the Use of Historical and Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nIn addition to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\\\"GAAP\\\") reporting, MACOM provides investors with financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP, such as: non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations and operating margin, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP income tax rate and non-GAAP interest (income) expense. In this release or elsewhere, we may alternatively refer to such non-GAAP measures as \\\"adjusted\\\" measures. This non-GAAP information excludes the effect, where applicable, of intangible amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest, acquisition and integration related costs, equity method investment gains and losses and the tax effect of each non-GAAP adjustment.\\nManagement believes these excluded items are not reflective of our underlying performance and uses these non-GAAP financial measures to: evaluate our ongoing operating performance and compare it against prior periods, make operating decisions, forecast future periods, evaluate potential acquisitions, compare our operating performance against peer companies and assess certain compensation programs. We believe this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into our ongoing performance and have therefore chosen to provide this information to investors to help them evaluate the results of our ongoing operations and enable more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\nA reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. We have not provided a reconciliation with respect to any forward-looking non-GAAP financial data presented because we do not have and cannot reliably estimate certain key inputs required to calculate the most comparable GAAP financial data, such as future acquisition costs, the possibility and impact of any litigation costs, changes in our GAAP effective tax rate and impairment charges. We believe these unknown inputs are likely to have a significant impact on any estimate of the comparable GAAP financial data.\\nInvestors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies because different companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\\nhttps://ir.macom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/macom-reports-fiscal-third-quarter-2023-financial-results\\nAtmel Corporation\\nMicrochip Technology Inc. is a leading provider of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions.

The midpoint of our guidance provided on May 4, 2023 was net sales of $2.289 billion.   \\nOn a GAAP basis: record gross profit of 68.1%; record operating income of $903.1 million and a record 39.5% of net sales; record net income of $666.4 million; and record EPS of $1.21 per diluted share. Our guidance provided on May 4, 2023 was for GAAP EPS of $1.15 to $1.16 per diluted share.   \\nOn a Non-GAAP basis: record gross profit of 68.4%; record operating income of $1.100 billion and a record 48.1% of net sales; net income of $905.3 million and record EPS of $1.64 per diluted share. Our guidance provided on May 4, 2023 was for Non-GAAP EPS of $1.63 to $1.65 per diluted share.   \\nPaid down $413.0 million of debt in the June 2023quarter. Cumulatively paid down $6.8 billion of debt over the last 20 quarters. Reduced net leverage to 1.29x.   \\nReturned approximately $349.2 million to shareholders in the June quarter through dividends of $208.9 million and the repurchase of approximately $140.3 million, or 1.8 million shares of our common stock, at an average price of $77.51 per share under our previously announced $4.0 billion stock buyback program. Cumulatively repurchased approximately $1.512 billion, or 20.3 million shares, over the last seven quarters.   \\nRecord quarterly dividend declared today for the September quarter of 41.0 cents per share, an increase of 36.2% from the year ago quarter.   \\nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were a record $2.289 billion, up 16.6% from net sales of $1.964 billion in the prior year's first fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $666.4 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, up from GAAP net income of $507.2 million, or $0.90per diluted share, in the prior year's firstfiscal quarter. For the firstquarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, GAAP net income was adversely impacted by amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with our previous acquisitions. Non-GAAP net income for the firstquarter of fiscal 2024was a record at $905.3 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, up from non-GAAP net income of $767.2 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in the prior year's first fiscal quarter. For the first quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, and losses on the settlement of debt. For the firstquarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release. Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 41.0 cents per share, up 36.2% from the year ago quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on September 5, 2023 to stockholders of record on August 22, 2023. \\\"Our June quarter results were in-line with the midpoint of our guidance as revenue grew 2.5% sequentially and 16.6% year over year, amid a weakening macro backdrop and increased business uncertainty,\\\" said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. \\\"We delivered record revenue of $2.29 billion during our first fiscal quarter, marking the 11th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Our team's disciplined execution, in combination with resilient end markets and a diverse customer base, helped to drive record non-GAAP gross and operating margins of 68.4% and 48.1%, respectively.\\\" Mr. Moorthy added, \\\"We continue to navigate a challenging market environment and are trending toward supply chain normalization as we continue to improve lead times for many of our products. In the June quarter, we further assisted customers in de-risking their inventory positions by pushing out non-reschedulable backlog to future quarters. China was our weakest region again, as macro softness drove weaker sell-through activity and inventory build at Chinese distributors. Even as our broad base of customers experience demand uncertainty, we expect our operating metrics to demonstrate resiliency through this business cycle.\\\"\\nEric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, \\\"We continued to pay down our debt with another $413.0 million of payments during the June quarter, reflecting a cumulative debt pay down of over $6.8 billion over the past 20 quarters, as we have enhanced our operating performance while actively managing the working capital requirements for the business. We ended the June 2023 quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 1.29x compared to 2.05x at the end of the June 2022 quarter. Our operating model has been, and remains, a strong cash generator and continues to demonstrate consistently high non-GAAP operating margins as we execute our Microchip 3.0 strategy.\\\" Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair, said, \\\"Microchip's board of directors approved a record dividend of 41 cents per share, which represents a 36.2% year-over-year increase. Given our cash flow generation during the June quarter, we are targeting to return $562.6 millionto our shareholders in the September quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Our board remains committed to increasing cash returns to shareholders with the goal of returning 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March 2025 quarter.\\\" Mr. Moorthy concluded, \\\"Considering the macro environment we face of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty, combined with the active steps we are taking to help customers with inventory positions to push out some of their backlog, we expect net sales in the September quarter to be up 1% to down 3% sequentially. At the mid-point of our guidance for the September quarter, net sales would be 9.3% higher than the year-ago quarter. Notwithstanding any nearterm macro weakness, we are confident that semiconductors remain the engine of innovation for the applications and markets we serve. Our focus on Total System Solutions and key market megatrends is fueling strong design-win momentum that we expect will drive above-market long-term growth.\\\"\\nMicrochip's Highlights for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2023:\\nPublished annual Sustainability Report, highlighting key sustainability goals, the strategies used to implement them, and progress made to further sustainable business practices.   \\nAnnounced the promotion of Rich Simoncic to executive vice president. Rich will continue to manage all of Microchip's analog business units while playing a larger role assisting the CEO with corporate initiatives such as strategic planning, total system solutions, market megatrends and investor relations.   \\nReleased updated, next-generation MPLAB\\u00ae ICD 5 and MPLAB PICkit\\u2122 5 in-circuit debuggers/programmers with advanced connectivity and power options for developers of designs based on PIC\\u00ae, AVR\\u00ae and SAM devices and dsPIC\\u00ae Digital Signal Controllers (DSCs).

The EQCO510 and EQCO5X31 devices offer a solid two-channel solution to send high-speed data signals up to 15 meters in both directions.   \\nExpanded our radiation-tolerant family of gigabit ethernet physical layers (PHY). The new VSC8574RT PHY supports both copper and fiber interfaces for added flexibility in space applications.   \\nLaunched a new cesium atomic clock that provides autonomous precise time of 100 ns holdover for months. The 5071B is a compact commercial timing product offering ease of deployment across multiple industries.   \\nAnnounced an industrial edge stack, more core library IP and conversion tools for the industry's most power-efficient mid-range FPGA. The new tools are designed to help customers slash time to innovation by making it easier to than ever to switch to PolarFire\\u00ae FPGAs and System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGAs.   \\nSecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook:\\nCapital expenditures for the quarter ending September 30, 2023 are expected to be between $90 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2024 are expected to be between $300 million and $400 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing capabilities to support the expected growth of our business.\\nUnder the GAAP revenue recognition standard, which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires.\\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, and losses on the settlement of debt. For the first quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our nonGAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items, or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models. We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars, including non-GAAP research and development expenses and nonGAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.\\nManagement believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results. Generally, gross profit fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels. Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading \\\"Supplemental Financial Information\\\"), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the September 2023 quarter between $85 and $95 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what ourstock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).\\nhttps://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/investor/press-release/MCHP_Announces_Record_Q1FY24_Financial_Results.080323.pdf\\nBroadcom Corporation\\nBroadcom Inc.

The Company spent $3,420 million on share repurchases and eliminations, consisting of $2,806 million in repurchases of 4.6 million shares and $614 million of withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards that vested in the quarter (representing approximately 1.0 million shares withheld).\\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company paid a cash dividend of $4.60 per share, totaling $1,914 million.\\nThe differences between the Company's GAAP and non-GAAP results are described generally under \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" below, and presented in detail in the financial reconciliation tables attached to this release.\\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Business Outlook\\nBased on current business trends and conditions, the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, ending July 30, 2023, is expected to be as follows:\\nThird quarter revenue guidance of approximately $8.85 billion; and   \\nThird quarter Adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately 65 percent of projected revenue.   \\nThe guidance provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release.

The Company undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise any of these projections, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\\nQuarterly Dividends\\nThe Company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $4.60 per share. The dividend is payable on June 30, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on June 22, 2023.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nThe non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. Broadcom believes non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons.\\nIn addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, litigation settlements, loss on debt extinguishment, gains (losses) on investments, income (loss) from discontinued operations, non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments, and other adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company's operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company's competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.\\nFree cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcom's free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.\\nAbout Broadcom Inc.\\nBroadcom Inc.

Gaming revenue was $2.04 billion, down 44% sequentially and down 33% from the prior year. Data Center revenue was $3.81 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 61% from the prior year.\\nThe shortfall relative to the May revenue outlook of $8.10 billion was primarily attributable to lower sell-in of Gaming products reflecting a reduction in channel partner sales likely due to macroeconomic headwinds. In addition to reducing sell-in, the company implemented pricing programs with channel partners to reflect challenging market conditions that are expected to persist into the third quarter.\\nData Center revenue, though a record, was somewhat short of the company's expectations, as it was impacted by supply chain disruptions.\\nSecond quarter results are expected to include approximately $1.32 billion of charges, primarily for inventory and related reserves, based on revised expectations of future demand.\\n\\\"Our gaming product sell-through projections declined significantly as the quarter progressed,\\\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \\\"As we expect the macroeconomic conditions affecting sell-through to continue, we took actions with our Gaming partners to adjust channel prices and inventory.\\n\\\"NVIDIA has excellent products and position driving large and growing markets. As we navigate these challenges, we remain focused on the once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvent computing for the era of AI,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"The significant charges incurred in the quarter reflect previous long-term purchase commitments we made during a time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty,\\\" said Colette Kress, EVP and CFO of NVIDIA.\\n\\\"We believe our long-term gross margin profile is intact. We have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term growth while managing near-term profitability. We plan to continue stock buybacks as we foresee strong cash generation and future growth,\\\" she said.\\n1  Announced in May 2022 in connection with the company's press release announcing its financial results for first quarter fiscal 2023.\\nThe preliminary results for the second quarter ended July 31, 2022, are an estimate, based on information available to management as of the date of this release, and are subject to further changes upon completion of the company's standard quarter and year-end closing procedures. This update does not present all necessary information for an understanding of NVIDIA's financial condition as of the date of this release, or its results of operations for the second quarter. As NVIDIA completes its quarter-end financial close process and finalizes its financial statements for the quarter, it will be required to make significant judgments in a number of areas. It is possible that NVIDIA may identify items that require it to make adjustments to the preliminary financial information set forth above and those changes could be material. NVIDIA does not intend to update such financial information prior to release of its final second quarter financial statement information, which is currently scheduled for Aug. 24, 2022.\\nNon-GAAP Measures\\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, this press release includes preliminary estimates of non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These preliminary estimates of non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, and income tax expense.\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, gains or losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.\\nA preliminary updated reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses and tax rate is as follows:\\nNVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company's non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\\nhttps://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-preliminary-financial-resultsfor-second-quarter-fiscal-2023\\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.

Please note, the guidance included in this release consists of predictions only, and is subject to a wide range of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond NXP's control. The guidance included in this release should not be regarded as representations by NXP that the estimated results will be achieved. Actual results may vary materially from the guidance we provide today. In relation to the use of non-GAAP financial information see the note regarding \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" below. For the factors, risks, and uncertainties to which judgments, estimates and forward-looking statements generally are subject see the note regarding \\\"Forward-looking Statements.\\\" We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, including the guidance set forth herein, to reflect future events or circumstances.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nIn managing NXP's business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures, that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\\\"GAAP\\\"). In measuring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing our gross margin and operating margin and when assessing appropriate levels of research and development efforts. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting NXP's business. We believe that they enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain non-cash expenses and share-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in NXP's underlying performance. This information also enables investors to compare financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management.\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of these and other similar items in NXP's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial statements portion of this release in a schedule entitled \\\"Financial Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Results (unaudited).\\\" Please refer to the NXP Historic Financial Model file found on the Financial Information page of the Investor Relations section of our website at   https://investors.nxp.com   for additional information related to our rationale for using these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as the impact of these measures on the presentation of NXP's operations.\\nIn addition to providing financial information on a basis consistent with GAAP, NXP also provides the following selected financial measures on a non-GAAP basis: (i) Gross profit, (ii) Gross margin, (iii) Research and development, (iv) Selling, general and administrative, (v) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, (vi) Other income, (vii) Operating income (loss), (viii) Operating margin, (ix) Financial Income (expense), (x) Income tax benefit (provision), (xi) Results relating to equity-accounted investees, (xii) Net income (loss) attributable to stockholders, (xiii) Earnings per Share - Diluted, (xiv) EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, and (xv) free cash flow, trailing 12 month free cash flow and trailing 12 month free cash flow as a percent of Revenue. The non-GAAP information excludes, where applicable, the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, the purchase accounting effect on inventory and property, plant and equipment, merger related costs (including integration costs), certain items related to divestitures, share-based compensation expense, restructuring and asset impairment charges, extinguishment of debt, foreign exchange gains and losses, income tax effect on adjustments described above and results from equity-accounted investments.\\nThe difference in the benefit (provision) for income taxes between our GAAP and non-GAAP results relates to the income tax effects of the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments that we make and the income tax effect of any discrete items that occur in the interim period. Discrete items primarily relate to unexpected tax events that may occur as these amounts cannot be forecasted (e.g., the impact of changes in tax law and/or rates, changes in estimates or resolved tax audits relating to prior year tax provisions, the excess or deficit tax effects on share-based compensation, etc.).\\nAbout NXP Semiconductors\\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.

The company is redefining the worlds of TVs, smartphones, wearable devices, tablets, digital appliances, network systems, and memory, system LSI, foundry and LED solutions.\\nhttps://semiconductor.samsung.com/\\nSamsung Electronics - Samsung Electronics Announces Second Quarter 2023 Results - 27/7/2023\\nQuarterly revenue of KRW 60.01 trillion, operating profit at KRW 0.67 trillion\\nGlobal IT demand and business environment to recover gradually in 2H; macroeconomic risks remain\\nSamsung Electronics today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023.\\nThe Company posted KRW 60.01 trillion in consolidated revenue, a 6% decline from the previous quarter, mainly due to a decline in smartphone shipments despite a slight recovery in revenue of the DS (Device Solutions) Division. Operating profit rose sequentially to KRW 0.67 trillion as the DS Division posted a narrower loss, while Samsung Display Corporation (SDC) and the Digital Appliances Business saw improved profitability.\\nThe Memory Business saw results improve from the previous quarter as its focus on High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and DDR5 products in anticipation of robust demand for AI applications led to higher-than-guided DRAM shipments. System semiconductors posted a decline in profit due to lower utilization rates on weak demand from major applications.\\nIn the mobile panel business, earnings were similar to the previous quarter on the back of solid sales of premium panels, while the large panel business continued to focus on QD-OLEDs in the premium market.\\nThe Device eXperience (DX) Division achieved strong profitability due to higher sales of premium TVs and digital appliances, an improved cost structure and increased operational efficiency. The Networks Business's revenue declined in major overseas markets including North America and Japan.\\nHarman posted revenue and profit growth, led by demand for consumer audio such as portable and True Wireless Stereo products. Harman also won the largest automotive order in its history in the quarter.\\nThe weakness of the Korean won against the US dollar, euro and major emerging currencies resulted in a positive impact on company-wide operating profit.\\nGlobal demand is expected to gradually recover in the second half of the year which should lead to an improvement in earnings driven by the component business. However, continued macroeconomic risks could prove to be a challenge in such recovery in demand.\\nThe DS Division will focus on sales of high-value-added products such as DDR5, LPDDR5x and HBM amid expectations of a recovery in demand. It will continue to strengthen mid- to long-term competitiveness by increasing investments in infrastructure, R&D and packaging technology, while also enhancing the completeness of the Gate-All-Around (GAA) process.\\nSDC's mobile panel business is expected to post improved earnings as major customers launch new smartphone models, while the large panel business will address year-end seasonal demand with a supply of ultra-large panels.\\nThe DX Division plans to sustain solid profitability with new foldable smartphone and wearable launches and by increasing sales of premium TVs and digital appliances. The Networks Business aims to win new projects to grow revenue and reinforce technology leadership in 5G core chips and software-based virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRAN).\\nThe Digital Appliances Business plans to expand the Bespoke lineup globally and increase sales of energy-efficient products featuring the Energy Savings Mode on SmartThings, while Harman is expected to improve profitability with higher sales of consumer audio products.\\nThe Company's total capital expenditures in the second quarter stood at KRW 14.5 trillion, including KRW 13.5 trillion for semiconductors and KRW 0.6 trillion for displays. Spending on memory was concentrated on completing the P3 infrastructure and the P4 framework for mid- to long-term supply. Foundry investments continued to focus on fabs in Taylor, Texas and Pyeongtaek, Korea to address the demand for advanced nodes, while investments in displays focused on infrastructure and module production enhancements.\\nMemory Business To See Improved Growth amid Stabilizing Market\\nThe DS Division posted KRW 14.73 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 4.36 trillion in operating losses for the second quarter.\\nThe Memory Business achieved its bit growth guidance even as it saw more limited price drops for both DRAM and NAND, which ultimately contributed to a quarter-on-quarter improvement in performance. As server customers continued inventory adjustment, overall purchase demand had not yet recovered. Due to the strong demand for generative AI, however, investment from the data center sector was concentrated on AI servers.\\nFor DRAM, the Memory Business exceeded bit growth guidance by expanding sales on applications of consumer, graphics and automotive in addition to expanding sales focusing on servers, especially by actively responding to rising demand for DDR5 and HBM for generative AI applications.\\nAs for NAND, the Memory Business actively responded to the demand for flagship smartphones with competitiveness in UFS 4.0 and also achieved bit growth guidance by increasing sales of gaming devices, branded products for retail and so on. Meanwhile, the price decline was considerably less than the previous quarter.\\nLooking to the second half of the year, the market is expected to gradually move toward stability considering increasing production cuts in the industry, while inventory adjustments by customers are likely to wind down.\\nIn mobile and PC applications, with the normalization of major customers' set inventory levels, Set-Build demand is expected to improve due to the launch of new smartphones and PC promotion in the second half of the year.\\nThe server demand is expected to recover gradually and, in terms of products, demand for DDR4 and DDR5 is also expected to improve.\\nBased on supply flexibility linked to market conditions, the Memory Business will optimize its portfolio by focusing on high value-added and high-density products. In DRAM, to strengthen leadership in high-performance servers and mobile high-end segments, the Memory Business will rapidly increase the share of leading-edge products such as DDR5, LPDDR5x and HBM.\\nIn the second quarter, the System LSI Business posted a lower-than-expected improvement in its earnings due to the delayed recovery of demand for semiconductors and customers' continued inventory adjustments.\\nHowever, the System LSI Business won a design award for automotive SoCs with a domestic OEM for their 2025 premium model, and it also continued efforts to expand SoC applications including actively discussing mid- to long-term cooperation with European customers.\\nThe System LSI Business expanded its applications to fingerprint authentication cards in the security business as well as Battery Management Systems (BMS) in the power management IC business.\\nIn the second half of 2023, the recovery of demand for major applications such as mobile is likely to be delayed due to depressed consumer sentiment and lower-than-expected reopening efforts in China.\\nThe System LSI Business is also seeking to resume supplying major customers by securing product performance for the flagship model and new business solutions aside from smartphones. For automotive SoC, it will continue focusing on winning orders from European OEMs in 2026.\\nThe Foundry Business saw its revenue increase quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter thanks to increased sales to some US customers, but operating profit declined significantly as utilization decreased due to fab expansion and uncertainties in short-term demand.\\nThe Foundry Business is smoothly mass producing its third product using GAA technology thanks to the stabilization of the 3-nanometer (nm) process, and the development of both the second generation of 3nm GAA technology and the 2nm GAA technology is on track and progressing well.\\nThe Foundry Business successfully held the SFF/SAFE 2023 event in the US and Korea, introducing its process roadmap and various technological innovations. It launched the Multi-Die Integration Alliance with ecosystem partners.\\nIn the second half of the year, although there are still considerable uncertainties, it expects demand to improve gradually.\\nThe Foundry Business will lay the foundation for growth by advancing the development completeness of the 3nm GAA process with improved Power, Performance and Area (PPA) and by expanding orders from large customers.\\nIt will keep striving to grow its product portfolio by continually developing mature processes, such as 8nm eMRAM, as well as 8-inch technologies for use in automotive applications.\\nSDC To Leverage New Technology To Build on Earnings\\nSDC posted KRW 6.48 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.84 trillion in operating profit for the second quarter.\\nFor mobile panels, SDC achieved results similar to the previous quarter's and thus maintained its market share by supplying OLED panels equipped with outstanding performance and technology.\\nFor the large panel business, SDC has been improving its business fundamentals with enhanced yield and productivity, and it is also strengthening the premium position of its QD-OLED products with the product mix upgrade centered on ultra-large 77-inch TVs.\\nIn the second half of the year, since SDC has several of its mobile panel customers due to release new products, it expects to see earnings improve. In particular, using its accumulated technological prowess in new areas such as HIAA and HOP, SDC aims to stay ahead of its competitors and seamlessly accommodate the mass production of new products from the customers.\\nFor large panels, uncertainty over demand is likely to persist in the second half. SDC will collaborate with its customers to boost sales of ultra-large TVs, which are performing well. In addition, SDC acquired eMagin, a microdisplay manufacturer, in May. SDC will actively develop technology to lead the Extended Reality (XR) display market, which is expected to grow rapidly.\\nMobile To Focus on New Foldable and Galaxy Ecosystem Devices in 2H\\nThe Mobile eXperience (MX) and Networks businesses posted KRW 25.55 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 3.04 trillion in operating profit for the second quarter.\\nOverall market demand declined from the previous quarter due to continued macroeconomic factors, including high interest rates and inflation.\\nSales decreased sequentially for the MX Business as the effect of the Galaxy S23 launch from Q1 faded. Mass market recovery was also delayed due to the continued economic downturn, affecting Q2 sales.\\nNevertheless, the Galaxy S23 series was able to achieve higher results than its predecessor in the first half, in terms of both volume and value.\\nThe MX Business's efforts to optimize operational efficiencies throughout R&D, manufacturing, and logistics, underpinned by stabilized prices of major raw materials, led it to maintain a double-digit margin.\\nFor the second half of 2023, the overall smartphone market is expected to return to year-on-year growth, especially in the premium market.\\nHowever, external forecasts for market growth have also been lowered, amid risks of a prolonged global economic downturn.\\nRegarding tablets, the overall market is expected to stay mostly flat, but the high-end segment is projected to increase.\\nThe MX Business will focus on the newly launched Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 5 series \\u2014 which feature refined and differentiated user experiences - further fortifying its leadership in the global foldable smartphone market.\\nFor the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy A series, the MX Business plans to enhance sales through close collaboration with its partners and sales programs tailored by region.\\nThe MX Business will also focus on boosting sales of its tablets and wearables, with a strong focus on its new high-end models, which were announced this week at the Galaxy Unpacked event.\\nThrough such activities and initiatives, the MX Business intends to grow its annual revenue in 2023, while securing sold double-digit profitability through enhanced operational efficiency.\\nVisual Display and Digital Appliances To Maintain Robust Performance in 2H\\nThe Visual Display and Digital Appliances businesses recorded KRW 14.39 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.74 trillion in operating profit for the second quarter.\\nDemand for TVs declined quarter-on-quarter due to seasonal spending trends, but the decrease in demand started to ease in comparison to the previous year. The Visual Display Business posted higher results year-on-year by focusing on sales of high-value-added products, such as Neo QLED/OLED/ultra-large TVs, and reducing overall costs.\\nIn the second half of 2023, the Visual Display Business expects seasonal strength to ease the decline in overall TV demand amid continued uncertainties in the business environment, while the premium market is projected to remain robust.\\nThe Visual Display Business will continue leading the industry through innovative products including 98-inch ultra-large screens, Micro LED lineups and the world's first large-sized OLED gaming monitor and also through differentiated marketing related to areas highly valued by its consumers, such as the environment, security and content.

With an expanded highly differentiated IoT portfolio, combined with our best-in-class High Performance Analog portfolio, we are well positioned to emerge stronger from this current cycle.\\\"\\nSecond Fiscal Quarter 2024 Outlook\\nBoth the GAAP and non-GAAP second fiscal quarter 2024 outlook below take into account, based on the Company's current estimates, export restrictions, inflationary pressure and other macroeconomic conditions. The Company is unable to predict the full impact such challenges may have on its future results of operations.\\nGAAP Second Fiscal Quarter 2024 Outlook\\nNet sales are expected to be in the range of $233.0 million to $243.0 million   \\nGAAP Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 42.6% to 44.8%   \\nGAAP SG&A expense is expected to be in the range of $63.2 million to $65.2 million   \\nGAAP R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $48.0 million to $50.0 million   \\nGAAP Intangible amortization expense is expected to be approximately $15.9 million   \\nGAAP Interest and other expense, net is expected to be approximately $23.2 million   \\nFully-diluted share count is expected to be approximately 64.1 million shares   \\nShare-based compensation is expected to be approximately $12.7 million, categorized as follows: $0.5 million cost of sales, $8.2 million SG&A, and $4.0 million R&D   \\nTransaction and integration expenses are expected to be approximately $10.0 million   \\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately $11.1 million   \\nDepreciation expense is expected to be approximately $9.1 million   \\nNon-GAAP Second Fiscal Quarter 2024 Outlook (see the list of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of Non-GAAP Gross margin, Non-GAAP SG&A expense, and Non-GAAP R&D expense to the most comparable GAAP measures set forth in the tables below under \\\"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Outlook\\\")\\nNon-GAAP Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 47.5% to 49.5%   \\nNon-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be in the range of $45.0 million to $47.0 million   \\nNon-GAAP R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $44.0 million to $46.0 million   \\nNon-GAAP normalized tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be approximately 12%   \\nNon-GAAP Diluted (loss) earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $(0.02) to $0.06   \\nThe Company is unable to include a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP normalized tax rate and non-GAAP Diluted loss per share to the corresponding GAAP measures as this is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the impact of share-based awards and the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets that are excluded from these non-GAAP measures. The Company expects the variability of the above charges to have a potentially significant impact on its GAAP financial results.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, this release includes a presentation of select non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP measures of gross margin, SG&A expense, R&D expense, operating margin, net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders, diluted (loss) earnings per share and normalized tax rate exclude the following items, if any:\\nShare-based compensation   \\nAmortization of purchased intangibles, impairments and credit loss reserves   \\nRestructuring and transaction costs (including costs associated with the acquisition of Sierra Wireless), and other acquisition or disposition-related gains or losses   \\nShare-based compensation acceleration expense related to the acquisition of Sierra Wireless   \\nLitigation expenses or dispute settlement charges or gains   \\nCumulative other reserves associated with historical activity including environmental and pension   \\nEquity method (loss) income   \\nInterest income from debt investments   \\nTo provide additional insight into the Company's second quarter outlook, this release also includes a presentation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude the items identified above because such items are either operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred by the Company in the normal course of the Company's business operations, or are not reflective of the Company's core results over time. These excluded items may include recurring as well as non-recurring items, and no inference should be made that all of these adjustments, charges, costs or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. For example: certain restructuring and integration-related expenses (which consist of employee termination costs, facility closure or lease termination costs, and contract termination costs) may be considered recurring given the Company's ongoing efforts to be more cost effective and efficient; certain acquisition and disposition-related adjustments or expenses may be deemed recurring given the Company's regular evaluation of potential transactions and investments; and certain litigation expenses or dispute settlement charges or gains (which may include estimated losses for which the Company may have established a reserve, as well as any actual settlements, judgments, or other resolutions against, or in favor of, the Company related to litigation, arbitration, disputes or similar matters, and insurance recoveries received by the Company related to such matters) may be viewed as recurring given that the Company may from time to time be involved in, and may resolve, litigation, arbitration, disputes, and similar matters.\\nNotwithstanding that certain adjustments, charges, costs or expenses may be considered recurring, in order to provide meaningful comparisons, the Company believes that it is appropriate to exclude such items because they are not reflective of the Company's core results and tend to vary based on timing, frequency and magnitude.\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's comparable financial performance between periods. In addition, the Company's management generally excludes the items noted above when managing and evaluating the performance of the business. The financial statements provided with this release include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures for the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2023 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, along with a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures (other than the non-GAAP normalized tax rate and non-GAAP Diluted (loss) earnings per share) to their most comparable GAAP measures for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The Company adopted a full-year, normalized tax rate for the computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision in order to provide better comparability across the interim reporting periods by reducing the quarterly variability in non-GAAP tax rates that can occur throughout the year. In estimating the full-year non-GAAP normalized tax rate, the Company utilized a full-year financial projection that considers multiple factors such as changes to the Company's current operating structure, existing positions in various tax jurisdictions, the effect of key tax law changes, and other significant tax matters to the extent they are applicable to the full fiscal year financial projection. In addition to the adjustments described above, this normalized tax rate excludes the impact of share-based awards and the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. For fiscal year 2024, the Company's projected non-GAAP normalized tax rate is 12% and will be applied to each quarter of fiscal year 2024. The Company's non-GAAP normalized tax rate on non-GAAP net income may be adjusted during the year to account for events or trends that the Company believes materially impact the original annual non-GAAP normalized tax rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, acquisitions, entity structures or operational changes and other significant events. These additional non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies.\\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\\nThis press release contains \\\"forward-looking statements\\\" within the meaning of the \\\"safe harbor\\\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, based on the Company's current expectations, estimates and projections about its operations, industry, financial condition, performance, results of operations, and liquidity.

(or \\\"the company\\\",   www.skhynix.com   ) today reported financial results for the second quarter of 2023. The company recorded revenue of 7.306 trillion won, operating loss of 2.882 trillion won (with operating margin of negative 39%), and net loss of 2.988 trillion won (with net margin of negative 41%) for the three-month period ended June 30, 2023.\\n\\\"Amid an expansion in generative artificial intelligence (AI) market, which has largely been centered on ChatGPT, demand for AI server memory has increased rapidly,\\\" the company said. \\\"As a result, sales of premium products such as HBM3 and DDR5 increased, leading to a 44% sequential increase in revenue for the second quarter, while operating loss narrowed by 15%.\\\"\\nAccording to SK hynix, sales of both DRAM and NAND products increased in the second quarter, with higher average selling price (ASP) of DRAM largely contributing to revenue growth. Although the price for general DRAM products such as DDR4 continued to decline on sluggish PC and smartphone demands, DRAM blended ASP rose in the quarter, offset by increased sales in high-end products used for AI servers.\\nMoreover, lower inventory valuation loss, as well as the company's ongoing cost reduction efforts, helped reduce operating loss.\\n* Operating margin in 1H: 1Q23 -67% \\u2192 2Q23 -39%\\nAt the quarterly earnings conference call held today, the company said the demand for AI memory will continue to stay robust, and that a clearer effect of production reduction by memory companies can be seen.\\nSK hynix, thereby, aims to expand sales of high-end DRAM products, including HBM3, DDR5 and LPDDR5, as well as 176-layer based SSD products, which would help accelerate earnings improvement.\\nThe company also announced that it will improve the quality and yields of 1b-nanometer, the fifth generation of the 10nm process technology, DRAM and 238-layer NAND this year and expand the scale of mass production once the industry upturn is visible. But, given that the inventory levels of NAND is higher than DRAM, the company has decided to further reduce NAND production.\\n\\\"The company's stance on consolidated investment, which is to reduce that by at least 50% compared to 2022, remains unchanged, but with resources secured by management efficiency, we will continue to invest to expand the production capacity of high-density DDR5 and HBM3 that will lead future market growth,\\\" said Kim Woohyun, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) at SK hynix.\\n\\\"Having passed the trough in the first quarter, the memory semiconductor market is seen to have entered the recovery phase,\\\" Kim said. \\\"SK hynix will strive to prop up earnings through its technological competitiveness in high-end products.\\\"\\nAbout SK hynix Inc.\\nSK hynix Inc., headquartered in Korea, is the world's top tier semiconductor supplier offering Dynamic Random Access Memory chips (\\\"DRAM\\\"), flash memory chips (\\\"NAND flash\\\") and CMOS Image Sensors (\\\"CIS\\\") for a wide range of distinguished customers globally.

These non-GAAP measures supplement our GAAP measures of performance or liquidity and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity. Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, free cash, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin do not have uniform definitions. These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management believes that such measures are meaningful to investors because they provide insight with respect to intrinsic operating results of the Company. Although the terms \\\"free cash\\\" and \\\"EBITDA\\\" are not defined in GAAP, the measures are derived using various line items measured in accordance with GAAP. Reconciling items to arrive at adjusted net earnings represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding the Company's intrinsic operations. Reconciling items to calculate adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EBITDA represent those same items used in computing adjusted net earnings, as relevant. Furthermore, the presented calculation of adjusted EBITDA is substantially similar to, but not identical to, a measure used in the calculation of financial ratios required for covenant compliance under Vishay's revolving credit facility.

We see continued growth in the back half of the year highlighted by our next generation 5nm product shipments and supported by our diversified business model.\\\"\\nQ2 2022 Financial Summary\\nRevenue of $6.6 billion increased 70% year-over-year driven by growth across all segments and the inclusion of Xilinx revenue.   \\nGross margin was 46%, a decrease of 2 percentage points year-over-year, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Non-GAAP gross margin was 54%, an increase of 6 percentage points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher Data Center and Embedded segment revenue.   \\nOperating income was $526 million, or 8% of revenue, compared to $831 million or 22% a year ago primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Record non-GAAP operating income was $2.0 billion, or 30% of revenue, up from $924 million or 24% a year ago primarily driven by higher revenue and gross profit.   \\nNet income was $447 million compared to $710 million a year ago primarily due to lower operating income. Record non-GAAP net income was $1.7 billion, up from $778 million a year ago primarily driven by higher operating income.   \\nDiluted earnings per share was $0.27 compared to $0.58 a year ago primarily due to lower net income and a higher share count as a result of the Xilinx acquisition. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.05 compared to $0.63 a year ago primarily driven by higher net income.   \\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $6.0 billion at the end of the quarter and debt was $2.8 billion. AMD repurchased $920 million of common stock during the quarter.   \\nCash from operations was a record $1.04 billion in the quarter, compared to $952 million a year ago. Free cash flow was $906 million in the quarter compared to $888 million a year ago.   \\nGoodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando were $50.4 billion.   \\nQuarterly Segment Financial Summary\\nAMD previously announced new segments beginning the second quarter to align financial reporting with the way AMD now manages its business in strategic end markets.    \\nData Center segment includes server CPUs, data center GPUs, Pensando and Xilinx data center products.     \\nClient segment includes desktop and notebook PC processors and chipsets.     \\nGaming segment includes discrete graphics processors and semi-custom game console products.     \\nEmbedded segment includes AMD and Xilinx embedded products.     \\nPrior period results have been conformed to the new reporting segments for comparison purposes.   \\nData Center segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 83% year-over-year driven by strong sales of EPYC\\u2122 server processors. Operating income was $472 million, or 32% of revenue, compared to $204 million or 25% a year ago. Operating income improvement was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.   \\nClient segment revenue was $2.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year driven by Ryzen\\u2122 mobile processor sales. Client processor ASP increased year-over-year driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales. Operating income was $676 million, or 32% of revenue, compared to $538 million or 31% a year ago. Operating income improvement was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.   \\nGaming segment revenue was $1.7 billion, up 32% year-over-year driven by higher semi-custom product sales, partially offset by a decline in gaming graphics revenue. Operating income was $187 million, or 11% of revenue, compared to $175 million or 14% a year ago. Operating income improvement was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating margin was lower primarily due to lower graphics revenue and higher operating expenses.   \\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up 2,228% year-over-year driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded revenue. Operating income was $641 million, or 51% of revenue, compared to $6 million or 11% a year ago. Operating income and margin improvement was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx revenue.   \\nAll Other operating loss was $1.5 billion as compared to $92 million a year ago due to amortization of intangible assets largely associated with the Xilinx acquisition.   \\nRecent PR Highlights\\nAt its Financial Analyst Day, AMD    detailed    leadership roadmaps and an expanded product portfolio to deliver its next phase of growth across the estimated $300 billion market for high-performance and adaptive computing solutions, including:    \\nNew details on the \\\"Zen 4\\\" core architecture, expected to deliver significant performance and power efficiency improvements over the previous generation.     \\nThe \\\"Zen 5\\\" core planned for 2024, which is built from the ground up to extend performance and efficiency leadership across a broad range of workloads.     \\nAMD CDNA\\u2122 3 graphics architecture featuring 3D die stacking, 4  th  generation Infinity Architecture, next-generation AMD Infinity Cache\\u2122 technology and HBM memory in a single package to power what are expected to be the world's first data center APUs, AMD Instinct\\u2122 MI300 accelerators.     \\nAMD RDNA  \\u2122  3 next generation graphics architecture expected to deliver more than 50% greater performance-per-watt compared to the prior generation.     \\nAMD XDNA  \\u2122  technology, the foundational architecture IP from Xilinx that consists of key technologies including the FPGA fabric and AI Engine (AIE), which is planned to be integrated across the AMD product lineup starting with the \\\"Zen 4\\\"-architecture based \\\"Phoenix Point\\\" mobile processors planned for 2023.     \\nAn expanded data center CPU portfolio, including the first AMD EPYC processor optimized for intelligent edge and communications deployments, codenamed \\\"Siena,\\\" and the \\\"Bergamo\\\" processors, expected to be the highest performance server processors for cloud native computing at their launch planned for the first half of 2023.     \\nAMD    completed    the acquisition of Pensando Systems in a transaction valued at approximately $1.9 billion to expand AMD's data center product portfolio with a high-performance data processing unit (DPU) and software stack.

(NYSE:TSM) is expected to win up to $5 billion in grants from the U.S. government for building a chip fabrication facility in Arizona.\\nBloomberg reported on Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the world's largest contract chipmaker would soon be announcing the deal, although it wasn't clear whether the award would come from the $52 billion CHIPS Act fund for boosting U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.\\nIn May 2020, TSMC announced plans to invest $12 billion in a semiconductor manufacturing facility in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to bolster its production capacity in the United States. Then in December the same year, plans for a second fab \\u2014 again, in Phoenix \\u2014 were announced, taking the total investment to $40 billion.\\nThe company said at the time: \\\"As one of TSMC's advanced fabs, TSMC Arizona will play a vital role in the U.S. government's goal to onshore semiconductor manufacturing and strengthen national economic competitiveness.\\\"\\nConstruction of the first fab began in April 2021 and volume production is expected to begin in the first half of 2025. The second fab is expected to be operational two or three years later.\\nThe company already operates a U.S. fab in the State of Washington.\\nAlso Read: GlobalFoundries To Scoop $1.5 Billion In CHIPS Act Grants: What It Means For Semiconductor Sector\\nTSMC's Main Customers Nearby\\nTSMC's largest customer is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which it calls \\\"Customer A\\\" on its Securities and Exchange Commission filings, accounted for 25%, or $17.5 billion, of the chipmaker's annual revenue in 2023, according to financial analyst and tech writer Dan Nystedt.\\nAlthough the company doesn't disclose its business dealings and customer details, it is widely believed that the company designated as \\\"Customer B\\\" in last year's filing is Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which was responsible for 11%, or $7.73 billion of TSMC's net annual revenue.\\nAmong its other customers are Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), all of which, along with both Apple and Nvidia, are based in California, making TSMC's Phoenix location rather handy.\\nFurther details of TSMC's federal grant and other awards under the CHIPS Act are expected to be announced over the coming days and weeks as President Joe Biden looks to cement the program as he ramps up his re-election campaign.\\nThe only official announcement of a CHIPS Act grant so far, has been GlobalFoundries Inc. (NASDAQ:GFS), which was awarded $1.5 billion to expand production facilities at its plant in Malta, New York and its Vermont facility.\\nThe Act was launched in 2022 to boost domestic production of semiconductors after crippling supply chain issues in the industry caused massive production delays for several industries.\\nNow Read: Biden's State Of The Union May Coincide With Government Shutdown: What To Expect, Sectors To Watch\\nPhoto: Shutterstock\",\n          \"#(1)\\nThis Week's News\\nYahoo Finance -

The prepayment, which is also subject to accrued interest, was made on June 21, 2023.\\n\\\"One of Air Canada's major financial objectives is to deleverage its balance sheet following the COVID-19 pandemic and prepaying these loans we received for our A220 aircraft is a significant step toward this goal. We appreciate EDC's assistance in purchasing these Canadian-built aircraft, which not only advanced our fleet modernization program to improve our fuel efficiency and competitiveness, but also helped to ensure that the investments Air Canada is making directly support jobs in Canada's aerospace industry and contribute to the country's economy,\\\" said Amos Kazzaz, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Air Canada.\\nThe prepayment of the loans for 19 Airbus A220-300 aircraft financed through EDC was achieved via:\\na full prepayment of Air Canada's 2021 credit facility with EDC for the acquisition of 15 Airbus A220-300 aircraft, and   \\na partial prepayment of Air Canada's 2020 credit facility with EDC for the acquisition of 18 Airbus A220-300 aircraft.   \\nAs a result of the prepayment, these aircraft will be added to Air Canada's unencumbered asset pool, bringing the total to approximately $5.4 billion, excluding Aeroplan.\\nThe amount of debt prepayments now totals approximately $1.28 billion since and including the repurchase of some of Air Canada's outstanding 4.000% convertible senior notes due 2025 completed last year, leading to a reduction in interest expense of approximately $115 million (approximately $72 million in cash) on an annualized basis.\\nhttps://media.aircanada.com/2023-06-21-Air-Canada-Announces-Prepayment-of-EDC-Financed-Loans-used-to-Acquire-19-Airbus-A220-300-Aircraft\\nANA Group - Star Alliance Named World's Best Airline Alliance at the Skytrax 2023 World Airline Awards - 20/6/2023\\nStar Alliance has once again won the title of World's Best Airline Alliance at the prestigious Skytrax World Airline Awards this year.

Due to the cyclicality nature of the industry, risk of commodity price (oil) exposure significantly impacts the airlines' performance outcomes.\\nIn this study, the traditional literature that underpins airline fuel hedging within a global setting is re-visited. The results from the existing literature are considered when conceptualizing a model that describes the impact of fuel hedging on a carriers's firm value using two measures, i.e. stock prices and Tobin's Q. Aside from the primary effects of fuel price hedging the study considers tertiary effects emitted by the origin and type of carrier. Combining these three aspects into a comprehensive study, contrasting legacy and low-costs at the same time as European and US carriers, over a horizon of nine years provides to the existing literature.\\nThe results of the study strengthen previous studies that report a limited impact of fuel hedging endeavors on operators' firm performance, ceteris paribus. These effects are slightly mitigated by the origin and the type of operator (legacy vs. low-cost) as well as tertiary control variables. As a consequence for practitioners, hedging may be seen as a tool of risk mitigation but not as a tool to strengthen an airlines firm value.\\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969699722001430\\nThe Industry\\nGlobal Aviation Outlook 2022\\nDelayed But Persuasive Recovery Despite New Turbulence\\nTravel will rebound strongly in 2022. Consumers are eager to travel and short-haul continental traffic will benefit from pent-up leisure demand. The closure of airspaces is a new blow for aviation and Covid is a headwind for China meaning the return to profitability may be pushed back, though the recovery is expected to continue\\nRecovery in aviation shifts to second stage in 2022, despite lasting volatility\\nThe pandemic has hampered the airline industry for much longer than expected. After the recovery began in 2021, new waves of the virus and fresh travel restrictions prevented the sector from scaling up. This year, however, is meant to be the year of delayed but sustained recovery, despite new scars. Global passenger traffic (RPK) recovered to 50% of pre-pandemic levels in the first months of 2022, but intercontinental traffic still has a long way to go.\\nStrong rebound in leisure travel expected for the summer of 2022\\nWhat we learned from 2021 is that when restrictions are lifted, demand for travel is still there, particularly for family visits and holidays. Many air passengers have suspended trips over the last two years leading to pent-up demand. This could also lead to 'front loading' this summer as consumers may consider these travel freedoms to be temporary. This suggests the recovery could lose strength later on.\\nPassenger traffic showed a significant increase, up two thirds of pre-pandemic levels in March in Europe's main airports. Airlines such as Ryanair have reported stronger international bookings - especially for short-haul international flights despite uncertainty from the war in Ukraine and higher ticket fares. Sales data on international tickets also point in this direction. Following a weak 2021 - especially in Europe - airports also expect a much better 2022.\\nFlights still less busy than before, leading to inefficiency\\nFlights have returned stronger than passenger numbers (possibly also to retain slot rights). Average global passenger load factors are still hovering around 70%, which shows that occupancy rates of aircraft are still lower than the pre-pandemic levels of >80%. This means that the cost-efficiency of airlines is still suboptimal which weighs on cost-income ratios. How load factors evolve is therefore something to watch as well in 2022.\\nStaff shortages challenge airlines in returning capacity to the market\\nParadoxically, hiring staff is now a critical factor in getting aircraft frequency back online, as airlines cut their workforces over the pandemic and cabin crew staff left for other sectors. Sick leave rates are also higher than before, which is leading to operational challenges. For every restored flight additional personnel and job markets are tight. This may limit expansion, frequencies and routes, especially in the US (e.g. Jetblue).\\nWar in Ukraine affects European airline traffic, as well as airfreight capacity\\nThe mutual closing of air spaces has led to a reduction of passenger traffic to and from Russia and Ukraine. Russia accounts for 4.5% of global revenue passenger kilometres (RPK), and because of the sanctions this will undoubtedly go down as Russian holidays to European countries will fall (Russian travelling accounted for 5.7% of European traffic in 2021). Domestic travel will also suffer.   \\nThe massive size of the Russian airspace avoidance affects some 10% of total passenger kilometres, according to IATA. Avoiding Russian airspace leads to detours and longer flights on East-West routes (e.g. from London, Amsterdam or Frankfurt to Tokyo, Seoul or Beijing). This will make trips less efficient and pushes up fuel costs even more, leading to higher ticket prices and extra capacity deployment.   \\nThe war in Ukraine also leads to direct new capacity cuts. The grounding of Russian carriers like Airbridge cargo (approx. 20 freighters) due to the closing of airspaces and disturbed supply of spare parts for freighters reduces capacity. Lufthansa expects global air cargo capacity to consequently be reduced by 10%, and global airfreight forwarder Kuhne Nagel indicated its capacity was down 30% on the Far-East Europe route following the sanctions. Due to scarce capacity, airlines are also considering re-allocating capacity to (possibly more profitable) other routes.   \\nIn total, hundreds of aircraft leased to Russian operators were still in Russian territory at the end of March, but they are not in service on the usual international routes anymore. It's uncertain how many eventually will be returned to the lessors, but this will also curtail global capacity.   \\nFull global recovery in passenger aviation not expected before 2024\\nAlthough we expect the recovery in aviation to continue this year, global passenger volume is not expected to recover in full before 2024. The war in Ukraine will temper the pace of recovery in 2022. In addition, a setback in the large Chinese airline market due to new Covid-related restrictions is slowing the return of travel volumes as well. Without these events, the recovery would undeniably have been stronger this year. For airlines based in the US, the impact will most likely be less severe than for European airlines, and the impact for low-cost carriers will also be less than for traditional intercontinental operating carriers. Despite the long haul to recovery, global passenger figures are still expected to eventually return to an annual growth trend of 3% or 4%.\\nContinued large regional differences in recovery - US in the front\\nOn the back of a large home market, airlines in the US performed better than European airlines over the last year. Mid-April 2022 passenger checks at US airports are back to around 90% of pre-pandemic levels and bookings appeared to be relatively strong. European flight numbers returned to 80%, but passenger load factors in Europe are still below the 70-80% US figures.\\nA relevant difference is that the American (highspeed) rail network is less intensively developed than the European system and distances are longer, so there are fewer alternatives while airline interconnectedness is high. In Europe though, rail network connections are being extended and governments, like the French, aim to shift short-haul flights to rail on short notice.\\nChinese airline market struggles with return of Covid restrictions\\nContrary to the US, the Chinese airline market has slumped after new Covid-related lockdowns. After an almost full return to pre-pandemic levels early in 2021, domestic airline travel figures started to decline again and were around 60% in early 2022. The risk of new measures has led to uncertainty about when the recovery might pick up again.\\nThe other major Asian growth market, India, is also seeing a strong trend of returning domestic airline traffic, which can also be seen in India's public transport. With a growing middle class, India could be a driving force behind the global recovery in the years to come.\\nAdapting to the post-pandemic world - fewer business seats, more freighters\\nThe dynamics of the post-pandemic world make it relevant for airlines to review their business models and strategy. Air networks may emerge smaller than previously expected and volumes could remain more volatile. With fewer business passengers, smaller aircraft may gain popularity. This will further benefit single-aisle aircraft, which are more flexible and easier to fill. Some airlines may consider changing their seat composition to include fewer business seats and more upgraded economy class seats ('economy plus').\\nIn today's world, freighters are also becoming more structurally important. Freight cushioned the drop in results for intercontinental carriers and due to high rates, it even counted long-haul international passenger routes will take the longest to recover and these are important for belly freight.\\nHigher fuel costs, but this won't slash traffic in 2022\\nThe gradual rise in oil prices in the second half of 2021 and the spike following the war in Ukraine significantly pushed up airline operational costs. Over the fourth quarter of 2021, jet fuel costs already accounted for 24% of airlines' total operating expenses and this will go up further. Even if oil prices ease in the remainder of 2022, results will be hit and this complicates the return to profitability for many airlines this year.\\nTo what extent airlines are affected depends on fuel hedging strategies. In general, low-cost carriers apply hedging rates more than traditional carriers, which implies that the impact for 2022 will be mitigated. Traditional carriers usually accept more risk on the fuel side, with lower hedging rates. This means higher kerosine prices tend to affect them more.\\nAnd there is also a difference between European and American airlines as the latter tend to bear the risk themselves (Southwest airlines using hedges is an exception).\\nAirlines like Air France, KLM and Delta have started to raise ticket fares with fuel surcharges. A positive note is that travellers seem willing to pay extra for their tickets at this point (with oil prices just above $100). Nevertheless, high fuel prices make fuel efficiency even more important.\\nAir cargo business keeps outperforming in 2022\\nOne thing the pandemic made clear is the need for flexibility and a fast alternative in case of unexpected circumstances. Air freight is more expensive but keeps supply chains agile, although timeliness is also several days longer than the normal six days ex-works to the destination airport. After a strong double-digit rebound in 2021, market growth will significantly slow this year with world trade flattening and a normalisation in e-commerce growth. Air cargo rates on the Far East-Westbound trade are still four times higher than pre-pandemic, but the competitive position for shippers remains relatively good amid disrupted supply chains.\\nAirfreight capacity remains tight\\nCapacity remains a limiting factor in airfreight through 2022 and the war in Ukraine has curtailed this further. Belly freight capacity has started to return, but not in full yet and compared to the 5-10% larger freight volume there's still a substantial deficit. The global fleet of full freighters increased by a net 40 in two years but this doesn't compensate. And this year, permission for transporting freight in passenger aircraft (e.g., for medical products during the pandemic) ends in the US as well as in the EU (from mid-2022).\\nAirlines, logistics players and container liners rush to set up freighter fleets\\nThe capacity shortage on the freight side has led to various initiatives to expand among airlines, logistics services providers and remarkably also shipping companies. Among others, Emirates, Qantas and Air Canada plan to expand their fleets from 2024 by adding freighters and converting passenger jets.\\nOn the logistics side, Amazon, DHL, UPS, as well as K+N and container liners CMA CGM, Maersk and possibly MSC are expanding and setting up (chartered) freighter fleets and airlines are revaluing the cargo activities as well. Amazon, in particular, is absorbing a lot of the market growth. Its freighter fleet has grown to 88 (mostly B767 60-ton) and it explained this will continue this year.\\nFor full report, see:   https://think.ing.com/downloads/pdf/article/global-aviation-outlook-delayed-but-persuasive-recovery-despite-new-turbulence\\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA)\\nAbout Us\\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) is the trade association for the world's airlines, representing some 290 airlines or 82% of total air traffic.

I thank all employees for their continued focus on improving all aspects of our company through effective and positive teamwork, and our customers for their loyalty.\\n*Adjusted CASM, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), adjusted EBITDA margin, leverage ratio, net debt, adjusted pre-tax income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share, and free cash flow are referred to in this news release. Such measures are non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP ratios, or supplementary financial measures, are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. Refer to the \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" section of this news release for descriptions of these measures, and for a reconciliation of Air Canada non-GAAP measures used in this news release to the most comparable GAAP financial measure.\\n\\\"All areas of the business contributed meaningfully during the quarter. Air Canada Cargo is expanding its network and fleet, Aeroplan is gaining more members and gross billings have increased 50% when compared to the first quarter of 2022, and Air Canada Vacations produced remarkable results. System yields improved approximately 9 per cent compared to the first quarter of 2022. We achieved a strong free cash flow* of nearly $1 billion. This will allow us to continue investing in our future, including by further deleveraging our balance sheet,\\\" said Mr. Rousseau.\\nFirst Quarter 2023 Financial Results\\nFirst quarter operating revenues of $4.887 billion increased $2.314 billion from the same quarter in 2022, primarily from higher passenger revenues due to increased travel demand. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, operating revenues increased about 10 per cent. Operated capacity increased about 53 per cent from the first quarter of 2022 (about 84 per cent of first quarter 2019 ASMs), in line with the projection provided in Air Canada's February 17, 2023 news release.   \\nOperating expenses of $4.904 billion increased $1.781 billion or 57 per cent from the first quarter of 2022. The increase included the impact of the year-over-year capacity increase, an increase of about 83 per cent in passengers carried and an approximate 30 per cent increase in jet fuel prices.   \\nOperating loss of $17 million, improved from an operating loss of $550 million in the first quarter of 2022.   \\nNet income of $4 million, increased $978 million from the first quarter of 2022. Diluted loss per share of $0.03 compared to a diluted loss per share of $2.72 in the first quarter of 2022.   \\nAdjusted net loss* of $188 million improved $559 million from the first quarter of 2022. Adjusted loss per share* of $0.53 compared to an adjusted loss per share of $2.09 in the first quarter of 2022.   \\nAdjusted CASM (adjusted cost per available seat mile) of 14.52 cents improved 6.9 per cent from the first quarter of 2022. The unit cost improvement resulting from higher operated capacity was partially offset by a favourable maintenance cost adjustment of $159 million recorded in the first quarter of 2022. First quarter 2023 CASM of 20.38 cents increased 2.5% from the first quarter of 2022 due to significantly higher fuel prices, higher ground package costs and higher passenger service costs due to higher traffic and higher selling costs, which are largely driven by revenues.   \\nAdjusted EBITDA of $411 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.4 per cent, improved from a negative adjusted EBITDA of $143 million in the first quarter of 2022.   \\nNet cash flows from operating activities of $1.437 billion increased $1.070 billion from the first quarter of 2022.   \\nFree cash flow of $987 million increased $896 million from the first quarter of 2022.   \\nOutlook\\nFor the second quarter of 2023, Air Canada plans to increase its ASM capacity by about 22 per cent from the same quarter in 2022. On May 4, 2023, Air Canada updated its 2023 guidance:\\nAssumptions were made by Air Canada in preparing and making forward-looking statements. As part of its assumptions, Air Canada assumes moderate Canadian GDP growth for 2023, that the Canadian dollar will trade, on average, at C$1.34 per U.S. dollar for the full year 2023 and that the price of jet fuel will average C$1.09 per litre for the full year 2023.\\nThe revised guidance for adjusted EBITDA reflects expected earnings resulting from an improvement in traffic and yield from a stronger-than-anticipated demand environment and lower-than expected fuel price. The revised guidance for adjusted CASM reflects adjustments to various expense items including those resulting from the higher-than-expected traffic. Air Canada's 2023 capacity guidance remains substantially unchanged.\\nAir Canada also modified the baseline comparison for its 2023 adjusted CASM guidance, comparing it to a 2022 instead of a 2019 baseline. Given the new cost environment, prior comparisons to the 2019 baseline are no longer as meaningful, and comparisons to 2022 are more appropriate.\\nAir Canada is not updating its 2024 targets at this time and will continue evaluating them as it progresses with its plans and executes on its strategic priorities.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nBelow is a description of certain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios used by Air Canada to provide readers with additional information on its financial and operating performance. Such measures are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.\\nAdjusted CASM\\nAir Canada uses adjusted CASM to assess the operating and cost performance of its ongoing airline business without the effects of aircraft fuel expense, the cost of ground packages at Air Canada Vacations, impairment of assets, and freighter costs as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis across periods less meaningful and generally allows for a more meaningful analysis of Air Canada's operating expense performance and a more meaningful comparison to that of other airlines.\\nIn calculating adjusted CASM, aircraft fuel expense is excluded from operating expense results as it fluctuates widely depending on many factors, including international market conditions, geopolitical events, jet fuel refining costs and Canada/U.S. currency exchange rates. Air Canada also incurs expenses related to ground packages at Air Canada Vacations which some airlines, without comparable tour operator businesses, may not incur. In addition, these costs do not generate ASMs and therefore excluding these costs from operating expense results provides for a more meaningful comparison across periods when such costs may vary.\\nAir Canada also incurs expenses related to the operation of freighter aircraft which some airlines, without comparable cargo businesses, may not incur. Air Canada had six Boeing 767 dedicated freighter aircraft in its operating fleet as at March 31, 2023 compared to one Boeing 767 dedicated aircraft as at March 31, 2022. These costs do not generate ASMs and therefore excluding these costs from operating expense results provides for a more meaningful comparison of the passenger airline business across periods.\\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\\nEBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to view operating results before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as these costs can vary significantly among airlines due to differences in the way airlines finance their aircraft and other assets. In calculating adjusted EBITDA, Air Canada excludes impairment of assets as this may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis across periods or to other airlines less meaningful.\\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin\\nAdjusted EBITDA margin (adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of operating revenues) is commonly used in the airline industry and is used by Air Canada as a means to measure the operating margin before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as these costs can vary significantly among airlines due to differences in the way airlines finance their aircraft and other assets.\\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share - Diluted\\nAir Canada uses adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share - diluted as a means to assess the overall financial performance of its business without the after-tax effects of impairment of assets, foreign exchange gains or losses, net financing expense relating to employee benefits, gains or losses on financial instruments recorded at fair value, gains or losses on the sale and leaseback of assets, gains or losses on debt settlements and modifications, and gains or losses on disposal of assets as these items may distort the analysis of certain business trends and render comparative analysis to other airlines less meaningful.\\nFor full financial report, see:   https://media.aircanada.com/2023-05-12-Air-Canada-Reports-First-Quarter-2023-Financial-Results\\nSpirit Airlines\\n6 February 2023\\nSpirit Airlines Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results\\nSpirit Airlines, Inc. (\\\"Spirit\\\" or the \\\"Company\\\") (NYSE: SAVE) today reported fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results.\\n\\\"I want to thank the entire Spirit Team for their contributions in overcoming the many challenges we faced during 2022. Thanks to their dedication and relentless pursuit to implement more efficient and effective strategies, we made excellent progress on the steps necessary to return Spirit to sustained profitability,\\\" said Ted Christie, Spirit's President and Chief Executive Officer.\\n\\\"Leisure demand has remained strong and our team is doing a great job maximizing revenue production,\\\" Christie continued. \\\"In the fourth quarter 2022, despite a significant number of weather-related flight cancellations during the peak holiday period, our team delivered better-than-expected unit revenue performance. In fact, when adjusting for capacity increases, our unit revenue performance in the fourth quarter was amongst the best in the industry, when compared to 2019.\\\"\\nFourth Quarter 2022 Financial Results\\nFor the fourth quarter 2022, Spirit reported a net loss of $270.7 million, or a net loss of $2.49 per diluted share. Excluding special items, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter 2022 was $12.6 million1, or an adjusted net income of $0.12 per diluted share1.\\nFor the fourth quarter 2022, Spirit reported a pre-tax loss of $340.3 million and a pre-tax margin of negative 24.5 percent. Adjusted pre-tax income for the fourth quarter was $23.0 million1 and adjusted pre-tax margin was 1.7 percent1.\\nOperations\\nFor the fourth quarter 2022, the Company's load factor was 81.0 percent, DOT on-time performance2 was\\n73.2 percent and Completion Factor2 was 97.0 percent.\\nRevenue\\nTotal operating revenues for the fourth quarter 2022 were $1.4 billion, an increase of 43.5 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2019 primarily due to increased flight volume and stronger operating yields. Total revenue per ASM (\\\"TRASM\\\") was 10.81 cents, up 17.0 percent compared to fourth quarter 2019 on 22.7 percent more capacity.\\nOn a per passenger flight segment basis, compared to the same period in 2019, total revenue per passenger flight segment (\\\"segment\\\") for the fourth quarter 2022 increased 22.5 percent to $135.62. Compared to the fourth quarter 2019, fare revenue per segment increased 22.1 percent to $64.31 and non-ticket revenue per segment increased 22.9 percent to $71.313. Non-ticket revenue per segment increased sequentially from the third quarter 2022 by $4.24, driven by strong take rates for ancillaries combined with the benefit from revenue management initiatives.\\nCost Performance\\nTotal GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2022 increased 100.8 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2019 to $1,697.0 million. Adjusted operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2022 increased 58.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter 2019 to $1,333.7 million4. Compared to the fourth quarter 2019, these increases were primarily driven by increases in flight volume, additional aircraft, higher fuel prices and inflationary wage pressures.\\nCompared to the guidance Spirit gave in mid-December 2022, the Company's total operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2022 came in better-than-expected primarily due to lower airport rents and landing fees driven by operating expense and revenue share adjustments at various airports served by Spirit.\\nAircraft utilization in the fourth quarter 2022 was 10.8 hours, down 7.7 percent compared to the 11.7 hours in the same period of 2019 and a sequential improvement from the third quarter 2022 of 1.9 percent. Continued constraint on flights to and from Florida and staffing challenges limited Spirit's ability to optimize its network and operate its fleet at full utilization in the fourth quarter 2022.\\n\\\"Our team did a great job navigating the various challenges in 2022 and closed the year with better-than- expected results,\\\" said Scott Haralson, Spirit's Chief Financial Officer. \\\"Despite some unexpected setbacks with Geared Turbo Fan (\\\"GTF\\\") engine availability issues, a continued stressed industry infrastructure, and other issues, we have been steadily building back to full fleet utilization and are on track to be close to full fleet utilization by the end of 2023. These issues, together with Airbus aircraft delivery delays, have led us to be more conservative with our capacity planning assumptions for 2023. We now anticipate full year 2023 capacity will be up 19 percent to 22 percent compared to 2022 and that our 2023 CASM ex-fuel will be in the high 6-cent range, which includes approximately 30 basis points of cost pressure related to the recently ratified pilot contract.\\\"\\nFleet\\nSpirit took delivery of 10 new A320neo aircraft during the fourth quarter 2022. The Company ended the quarter with 194 aircraft in its fleet, an increase of 33.8 percent since the end of fourth quarter 2019.\\nIn January 2023, the Company signed an agreement to sell 29 unencumbered A319ceo aircraft powered with V2500 engines to Gryphon Trading Company, LLC (\\\"Gryphon\\\"), with anticipated deliveries to Gryphon beginning in the first quarter 2023 through the end of the third quarter 2024. The Company expects to remove 14 and 15 A319ceo aircraft from its operating fleet in 2023 and 2024, respectively. The other two A319ceo aircraft in our operating fleet are anticipated to be returned to the lessor upon lease expiration in 2025.\\nLiquidity and Capital Deployment\\nSpirit ended fourth quarter 2022 with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term investment securities and liquidity available under the Company's revolving credit facility of $1.8 billion.\\nDuring the fourth quarter 2022, the Company completed a private offering of an additional $600 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the \\\"Senior Secured Notes\\\") by Spirit IP Cayman Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Spirit Loyalty Cayman Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (together the \\\"Issuers\\\"). As of December 31, 2022, the Issuers had $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding.\\nSpirit increased the commitment under its senior secured revolving credit facility by $60.0 million to $300.0 million during the fourth quarter 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the entire $300 million remained undrawn and available.\\nTotal capital expenditures, including net pre-delivery purchase deposits, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, were $246.1 million, primarily related to the purchase of spare parts, including four spare engines, two flight simulators, and expenditures related to the building of Spirit's new headquarters campus in Dania Beach, Florida.\\nForward Looking Guidance\\nThe first quarter and full year 2023 guidance items provided in this release are based on the Company's current estimates and are not a guarantee of future performance. There could be significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors discussed in the Company's reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Spirit undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements or estimates.\\nAdjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures, which are provided on a forward-looking basis. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP forward- looking measures on a forward-looking basis where the Company believes such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items included in/excluded from the GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred and are out of the Company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Non-GAAP forward- looking measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\\nFull Year 2022 Highlights\\nOur People\\nIn 2022, Spirit maintained its focus on building an engaged workforce, while navigating a tightening labor market.

Despite the summer growth anticipation efforts since January, operational difficulties arose in Europe and the United States, mainly due to labour shortages at airports.\\nAir France and KLM are doing their utmost to mitigate these challenges and has prioritised safeguarding the trust of our customers. For this quarter, it resulted into 70 million euros additional compensation costs.\\nCapacity\\nIn this recovery context, the Group expects the capacity in Available Seat Kilometers for Air France-KLM Network passenger activity at an index of\\n80% to 85% in the Third quarter of 2022   \\n85% to 90% in the Fourth quarter of 2022   \\nCirca 80% for the Full Year 2022   \\nAll indices compared to the respective period of 2019.\\nThe capacity for Transavia in Available Seat Kilometers is expected at an index above 100 for the full year and in the third and fourth quarter 2022 compared to 2019.\\nYield\\nThe yield environment should remain high for the rest of 2022 with a strong summer demand resulting in yield levels above 2019.\\nExpected operating result\\nSignificantly positive in the third quarter   \\nPositive in 2022, for the first time since 2019   \\nCash\\nAs of June 30 2022, the Group has a strong 11.9 billion euros of liquidity and credit lines at disposal.\\nFull year 2022 Net Capex spending is estimated at circa 2.5 billion euros, which is 80% fleet & fleet related and 20% IT & Ground related.\\nAir France-KLM made major steps to pave the financial trajectory\\nspending is estimated at circa 2.5 billion euros, which is 80% fleet & fleet related and 20% IT & Ground related.   \\nAir France-KLM made major steps to pave the financial trajectory   \\nIn February, Air France-KLM announced plans for a set of equity strengthening measures up to 4 billion euros.   \\nLater in June, the Group successfully completed a 2.3 billion euros rights issue, with CMA-CGM becoming a new strategic shareholder and a reference commercial partner in the cargo activity. Air France-KLM / Air France redeemed 1.6 billion euros of the French State perpetual bonds (including coupon), aiming to redeem at least 75% as soon as possible.   \\nIn the meantime, KLM fully repaid the State backed RCF and direct Dutch State loan amounting for 942 million euros. 2.4 billion euros RCF and State Loan is still available, and KLM expects to strengthen its balance sheet with positive net results and further equity measures are being contemplated.   \\nAir France-KLM and Apollo have closed on the 28th July an investment of 500 million euros by Apollo Funds to finance an ad hoc affiliate of Air France owning a pool of spare engines, as per the agreement signed on July 13th. In alignment with the requirement of article 77 bis of the European Commission's \\\"Temporary Framework for State aid recapitalization measures\\\", proceeds from the investment will be used to further redeem outstanding French State perpetual bonds issued in late April 2021.   \\nLater in 2022-2023, the Group will contemplate possible hybrid bond issuances up to 1.2 billion euros subject to market conditions.   \\nThe restoration of negative equity will be done through net profit generation and quasi/equity projects.\\nAir France-KLM Group: Second quarter operating margin at 2019 level despite the steep increase of fuel cost\\nIn the Second quarter 2022, the Air France-KLM Group posted a positive operating result of 386 million euros, up by 1,145 million euros at a constant currency compared to last year, and was driven by an increase of capacity. In parallel, the increase of load factor and yield generated an increase of the unit revenue.\\nNet income amounted to 324 million euros in the Second quarter 2022, an increase of 1.8 billion euros compared to last year. The recognition of tax assets at KLM group for an amount of around 300 million euros supported the positive net income generation.\\nIn a challenging cost environment, transformation programs contain the unit cost up 2.4% with 15% capacity below 2019.\\nThe unit cost is up 2.4% at a constant fuel price and constant currency versus the Second quarter 2019, with a capacity down by 15%. The ongoing transformation programs enable Air France-KLM to limit the impact of increasing costs such as airport and ATC charges, and the KLM Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) delayed implementation.\\nCompared to June 2019, the number of Full Time Equivalents (FTE's) of Air France excluding Transavia reduced by 16% and by 13% for KLM.\\nStaff costs decreased in the Second quarter by 11% compared to the same quarter in 2019 thanks to FTE reduction and the French government support on wages. Corrected for government support on wages, staff costs decreased by 9%.\\nBusiness review\\nNetwork: Significant improvement in operating result\\nSecond quarter 2022 revenues increased by 137.4% at constant currency to 5,753 million euros. The operating result amounted to 352 million euros, a 1,013 million euros increase at constant currency compared to last year.\\nPassenger network: Double-digit yield increase on most regions and on both economy and premium cabins\\nSecond quarter 2022, capacity in Available Seat Kilometers (ASK) was 69.4% higher than last year and at 82% of 2019 Second quarter level which was in the middle of the Group's guidance provided during the First quarter 2022 results presentation.\\nIn response to the rise in fuel prices and other external costs, the Group proceeded to different fare increases during the first half of the year across all long-haul flights. The amount of the increase varies according to destination and class of travel, and applies to flights operated by Air France and KLM. Additionally, the spike in travel demand, the strong performance in Premium cabins, and the solid corporate traffic recovery have all led to a yield above the 2019 level in the second quarter.\\nThe Second quarter result is driven by a strong performance of the entire network:\\nNorth Atlantic: Strong improvement since mid-January driven by the strong traffic recovery, with strong yield due to fare increases and a positive cabin mix. The second quarter showed new bookings outpacing 2019 levels.   \\nCapacity discipline on South America routes combined with a very resilient demand led to a strong yield. Corporate traffic ramped up quickly in the same time.   \\nAsia: The strong yield performance is due to limited capacity and the group continues to observe important differences between the regions. South East Asia and India showed positive dynamic in yield and traffic.   \\nCaribbean & Indian Ocean: The yields improved thanks to successive fare increases and a positive cabin mix effect.   \\nAfrica: A strong corporate recovery was observed in all areas. For KLM, the performance was driven by East and South Africa with strong yield increase linked to positive cabin mix and a positive economy yield evolution. For Air France, performance was driven by West and Central African countries with a good steering strategy.   \\nMiddle-East: The second quarter performance stayed strong thanks to Dubai, especially on premium cabins and an increased traffic on some routes.   \\nMedium-haul: Strong booking dynamic since March. KLM is impacted by operational challenges and restrictions on flight departures from Amsterdam which led to traffic restriction. The yield is above 2019, especially on leisure routes with network capacity constraints and a positive competition environment.   \\nShort-haul: The network was able to absorb capacity recovery month over month thanks to business motive dynamism. Yield is above 2019 helped by steering yield initiatives.   \\nDuring the Second quarter, Air France added three Airbus 350-900 and two Airbus A220-300. One B777-200, one Airbus 320, three Airbus 319, two Embraer 170 and five Canadair Jet 1000 were phased out. KLM phased in three Embraer 195 E2. The Group will continue to introduce new generation aircraft to its fleet in order to improve its economic and environmental performance.\\nCargo: Strong yield increase mitigates traffic impact on Asia trade lanes\\nCompared to the Second quarter 2021, cargo capacity strongly increased by 27.4% in Available Ton Kilometers, mainly due to the increase in worldwide belly capacity, except for Asia. This limited belly capacity to Asia affected the overall traffic which resulted in a traffic decrease of 17.2% and contributed to an overall decrease in load factor by 27.9 points. Yields, however, remain at a consistently high level (+17.4% vs. 2021), leading to a total Second quarter revenue performance at last year's level.\\nWhen compared to the pre-COVID year 2019, cargo capacity in the Second quarter was still 8% below 2019. However, due to exceptional yield performance - driven by high demand - total revenues in the Second quarter of 2022 were 76% higher than 2019.\\nIn May, Air France-KLM announced its entry into a strategic partnership with CMA-CGM Air Cargo (CCAC). The partnership agreement is currently being worked out and expected to be finalized before the end of 2022.\\nIn June, Air France-KLM Cargo won the Air Cargo Industry Achievement Award for their pioneering work in the development and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel and the fast expansion of its leading SAF program.\\nTransavia: Capacity above pre-crisis level with a load factor of 85%\\nIn the Second quarter of 2022, the demand recovery in leisure traffic in Europe and North Africa continued. Compared to last year, the capacity in the Second quarter increased by 221.9%, traffic increased by 358.2%, and the number of passengers increased by 346.8%. Last year, Second quarter was heavily impacted by travel restrictions in Europe and North Africa.\\nThe Operating result was slightly negative at -18 million euros, although improved by 80 million euros compared to the Second quarter of 2021.\\nCapacity in the Second quarter was above the level of the Second quarter of 2019 and unit revenue even above the Second quarter 2019 mainly driven by a strong yield improvement.\\nThe fleet of Transavia is approaching 100 aircraft, to further capture the strong demand of leisure traffic in Europe.\\nMaintenance business: Operating margin above 2019 level\\nThe Second quarter operating result stood at 57 million euros, an increase of 61 million euros at constant currency versus the Second quarter 2021 thanks to a higher activity and an operational improvement.\\nTotal revenues increased by 34.1% in the Second quarter while third party revenues increased by 35.1%, showing a strong recovery. The increase in internal revenues is consistent with the activity increase of the Air France-KLM airlines compared to the Second quarter 2021.\\nThe operating margin stood at 6.3%, which is 6.7 points higher than the operating results in the Second quarter 2021. The half year margin amounts to 5.8%, which is at the level of the pre-covid period when excluding the states support.\\nDuring the second quarter, Air France-KLM and Apollo Global Management announced the signing of a definitive agreement for Apollo managed funds and entities to make a 500 million euros investment in to an ad hoc operating affiliate of Air France that will own a pool of spare engines dedicated to the airline's Engineering and Maintenance activities.\\nSecond quarter: Positive EBITDA and strong ticket sales reinforces the adjusted operating free cash flow and supports net debt reduction by 2.2 billion euros\\nThe Group generated an adjusted operating free cash flow in the Second quarter 2022 of 1,532 million euros, an increase of 1,322 million euros compared to last year, mainly driven by a positive change in working capital of 1,510 million euros.

ANA HOLDINGS INC. will invest in human resources, aircraft and technology while continuing to restore its financial base, reducing interest-bearing debt.   \\nANA HOLDINGS INC. (hereinafter \\\"ANA HD\\\") today reports its financial results for the nine months ended December 31, 2022.\\nOverview\\nIn the first nine months of fiscal year 2022 (April 1, 2022 - December 31, 2022; hereinafter the \\\"nine months ended December 31, 2022\\\"), passenger demand is rapidly recovering with ease of travel restrictions on domestic flights as well as less entry restrictions in various countries for international flights.\\nUnder these economic and operating conditions, the increased revenue is mainly due to the Air Transportation business that contributed to an operating revenue of 1,258.6 billion yen for the nine months ended December 31, 2022. ANA HD recorded an operating income of 98.9 billion yen, ordinary income of 92.3 billion yen, and net income attributable to owners of the parent was 62.6 billion yen.\\n\\\"With the easing of travel restrictions in the last quarter, we were excited to offer our high-quality customer service to more passengers and serve additional destinations, as reflected by our positive financial performance,\\\" said Kimihiko Nakahori, Executive Vice President and Group Chief Financial Officer of ANA HD. \\\"The ability to do this is a testament to our employees who have persevered over the last few years and worked together to position the ANA Group for the future.\\\"\\nAir Transportation\\nInternational Passenger Service (ANA)   \\nThe number of international passengers increased five times year-on-year, and revenue increased by six times, behind strong demand for connections between North America and Asia as well as business demand from Japan resulting from the easing of entry restrictions in various countries. Demand for travel to Japan began to recover from October with the easing of Japan's border control measures.   \\nANA increased the number of flights on North America and Asia routes to/from Narita Airport to accommodate transit demand, and expanded operations on routes to/from Haneda Airport as well in response to recovering demand to/from Japan. ANA has gradually recovered operations of Europe routes despite the continued impact of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, while flights to/from China remain limited due to continued border restrictions in China.   \\nDomestic Passenger Service (ANA   \\nWith limited impact from the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, passenger demand steadily increased on domestic routes. Starting in October, leisure demand was stimulated by the government's travel support program, and both passenger volume and revenue were 1.9 times higher than in the same period of the previous year.   \\nANA fully resumed operations of the Boeing 777 aircraft with completed engine refurbishment, actively increasing capacity on certain flights and adding extra flights mainly on weekends and holidays in order to meet recovering demand. In October, ANA started code-sharing on flights operated by Amakusa Airline, Inc. and Japan Air Commuter Co., Ltd. for routes such as Fukuoka - Amakusa and Kagoshima - Tanegashima.   \\nCargo Service (ANA)   \\nInternational cargo volume declined year-on-year as a result of less cargo operations utilizing passenger aircraft temporarily dedicated for cargo transport as passenger demand increased, and a decline in demand for automobile-related parts.   \\nDespite a decline in revenue in the third quarter \\uff08October-December\\uff09 compared to the previous quarter due to softening demand, revenue was higher than in the same period of the previous year for the nine months ended December 31, 2022 as a result of taking in high-yield cargo such as oversized commercial products and capturing demand between Asia and North America.   \\nLCC (Peach Aviation)   \\nBoth passenger volume and revenue were significantly higher year-on-year due to an increase in demand as a result of eased travel and entry restrictions in Japan as well as in various countries.   \\nIn response to increasing demand on domestic routes, Peach increased frequency on the Narita - Sapporo route and the Narita - Fukuoka route. For international routes, the Seoul and Taipei routes resumed in August, and the Kansai - Bangkok route was newly launched in December after all flights had been suspended since April 2021.   \\nOthers   \\nOther revenue from the Air Transportation business was 107.6 billion yen (up 11.4% year-on-year from 96.6 billion yen). This includes revenue from the mileage program, in-flight sales revenue, revenue from maintenance contracts and other sources.\\nAirline Related, Travel Services, Trade and Retail, and Others\\nAirline Related   \\nRevenue increased from the same period of the previous year, due to increase in airport handling service support, such as check in service and baggage loading, in addition to in-flight meal-related operations that were in line with the recovery in passenger demand, as well as an increase in handling of international cargo volume.   \\nTravel Services   \\nFor domestic travel, as demand steadily recovered and backed by the government's travel support program, the volume of dynamic package products increased for all regions, and \\\"ANA Traveler's Hotel\\\" products performed well. For overseas travel, tours to Hawaii resumed in April for the first time in two years, and tour destinations were also expanded sequentially to various countries. As a result, revenue increased from the same period of the previous year.   \\nWorking to create a \\\"world where people can live on miles,\\\" the ANA Group renewed its \\\"ANA Mileage Club\\\" mobile application in October as a platform where users can access daily life services that are offered by the ANA Group. The ANA Group will further improve convenience by expanding opportunities to \\\"earn and spend miles\\\" both in the daily life scene and online.   \\nTrade and Retail   \\nAs passenger demand recovered, sales increased at ANA FESTA shops in airports and the handling volume of semiconductors for electronics businesses increased. As a result, operating revenue increased from the previous year.   \\nOthers   \\nWhile there was an increase in contracted lounge operation business, revenue declined year-on-year as there was a large sale of property in the previous year in the real estate sector.   \\nhttps://www.anahd.co.jp/group/en/pr/202302/20230202.html?_gl=1*1kz3mal*_ga*NzE4ODQ1MzkzLjE2NzU2NTExMDA.*_ga_32F297W9WL*MTY3NTY1MTEwMC4xLjEuMTY3NTY1MTE2OC4wLjAuMA   ..\\nAmerican Airlines Group (NASDAQ: AAL)\\nAmerican Airlines Group Inc. was formed on December 9, 2013, with the closing of the merger between American Airlines and US Airways Group.

The company has accrued approximately $211 million to its profit-sharing pool, which for the purposes of 2022 was measured as the 12-month period ended March 31, 2023, and will be paid to team members in May.\\nLiquidity and balance sheet\\nAmerican generated record operating and free cash flow of $3.3 billion2 and $3.0 billion2, respectively, in the first quarter. The company reduced total debt4 by more than $850 million in the quarter. Strengthening the balance sheet continues to be a top priority, and the company is approximately 60% of the way to its goal of reducing total debt by $15 billion by the end of 2025. As of March 31, 2023, American had reduced its total debt by more than $9 billion from peak levels in the second quarter of 2021. The company ended the quarter with approximately $14.4 billion of total available liquidity, comprised of cash and short-term investments plus undrawn capacity under revolving and other short-term credit facilities.\\nGuidance and investor update\\nBased on demand trends and the current fuel price forecast and excluding the impact of special items, the company expects its second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share3 to be between $1.20 and $1.40. American continues to expect its full-year 2023 adjusted earnings per diluted share3 to be between $2.50 and $3.50. The company's forecasts include the estimated impact of anticipated new labor agreements.\\nFor full financial report, see:   https://s21.q4cdn.com/616071541/files/doc_news/2023/04/1Q23-Financials.pdf\\nBritish Airways (LSE: BAY)\\nAbout British Airways\\nBritish Airways is a full-service global airline, offering year-round low fares with an extensive global route network flying to and from centrally located airports.\\nhttps://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/about-ba?source=BOT_about_ba\\nExplore our past\\nBritish Airways can trace its origins back to the birth of civil aviation, the pioneering days following World War I.

The unprecedented disruption caused by COVID-19 to the global aviation industry and the subsequent travel and operational restrictions around the world have continued to affect our business severely. Notwithstanding these challenges, the situation did improve as 2021 progressed.\\nThe second half of the year is traditionally stronger than the first half, and this was the case for us in 2021. The exceptional performance of our cargo business, especially during the second-half peak season, was extremely encouraging. Nevertheless, we continued to face serious challenges and despite the considerable improvement in results in the second half of the year, our overall loss for the full year was still substantial.\\nThe Cathay Pacific Group's attributable loss was HK$5,527 million in 2021 (2020: loss of HK$21,648 million). The loss per ordinary share in 2021 was HK95.1 cents (2020: loss per ordinary share of HK424.3 cents). The Group's attributable profit was HK$2,038 million in the second half of 2021 (2021 first half: loss of HK$7,565 million; 2020 second half: loss of HK$11,783 million). Cathay Pacific reported an attributable profit of HK$3,303 million in the second half of 2021 (2021 first half: loss of HK$5,031 million; 2020 second half: loss of HK$10,032 million).\\nThe loss for 2021 includes impairment and related charges of HK$832 million, mainly relating to 12 aircraft that are unlikely to re-enter meaningful economic service before they retire or are returned to lessors, HK$385 million in restructuring costs and a HK$210 million gain on the dilution of an associate interest in Air China Cargo. This compares to impairment and related charges of HK$4,056 million in 2020 relating to 34 aircraft (and to certain airline service subsidiaries' assets) and HK$2,383 million of restructuring costs. Adjusting for these exceptional items, the Cathay Pacific Group's attributable loss for 2021 was HK$4,520 million (2020: loss of HK$15,209 million), and Cathay Pacific's loss for 2021 was HK$776 million (2020: loss of HK$12,195 million).\\nCathay Pacific celebrated an important milestone in our history in 2021 as we marked 75 years of bringing people together as Hong Kong's home airline. Though we have certainly experienced our share of challenges over the years, COVID-19 key among them, we have also had incredible successes. Throughout our history, we have connected people to new destinations, welcomed the arrival of state-of-the-art aircraft and launched exciting innovations. As our home city has grown, so have we, and we are immensely proud to have represented Hong Kong over the past 75 years and to have helped it grow into one of the leading international aviation hubs in the world.\\nBut 2021 was not just a year for reflecting on our past. The launch of \\\"Cathay\\\", our new premium travel lifestyle brand, has opened an exciting new chapter. Cathay aims to bring all that we love about travel together with everyday lifestyle. This will simplify the way our customers interact with us, including how they earn status and use miles, and will enable us to engage with them not only when they fly with us, but every day.\\nWe also celebrated the inaugural flight of the newest addition to our fleet, the Airbus A321neo, in August. These state-of-the-art passenger aircraft provide the best short-haul experience in the world. Cathay Pacific has already taken delivery of five A321neos and will have 16 in its fleet by the end of 2023.\\nWe continued our commitment to achieving greener aviation by pledging to use sustainable aviation fuel for 10% of Cathay Pacific's total fuel consumption by 2030, and by becoming a founding member of the Aviation Climate Taskforce, a new non-profit organisation founded to tackle the challenge of eliminating carbon emissions in aviation through innovation and collaboration. These initiatives will help the Group achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\\nBusiness performance of Cathay Pacific\\nThe introduction of strict quarantine requirements for Hong Kong-based aircrew in February 2021 had a substantial impact on our travel business. To operate the remaining schedules, we introduced voluntary closed-loop duty cycles for our Hong Kong-based aircrew, comprising a 21-day duty cycle followed by a 14-day quarantine period. These arrangements have been very demanding for our aircrew and we are incredibly appreciative to them for their support and their tireless professionalism in the face of extremely challenging circumstances.\\nOperational and travel restrictions remained in place throughout the year, and this heavily constrained our ability to operate more flights. We reduced our flight schedule towards the end of December in response to the latest crew quarantine requirements in Hong Kong, and ended the year operating a considerably smaller amount of our pre-COVID-19 passenger capacity than we had planned.\\nComparing 2021 with 2020 as a whole, the operating performance in 2021 was generally weaker due in large part to the first two months of 2020 being relatively strong ahead of the full impact of COVID-19. Passenger revenue decreased by 61.6% to HK$4,346 million in 2021 compared with 2020. Revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) decreased by 79.5%. Capacity, measured in available seat kilometres (ASK), was down by 61.8%. We carried 717 thousand passengers, an average of 1,965 per day, 84.5% fewer than in 2020. Passenger load factor was 31.1% compared with 58.0% in 2020.\\nOur cargo business performed exceptionally well. Cargo revenue in 2021 was HK$32,377 million, an increase of 31.8% compared to 2020. Cargo revenue tonne kilometres (RFTK) decreased by 1.1%. Capacity, measured by available cargo tonne kilometres (AFTK), decreased by 10.9%. Load factor increased by 8.1 percentage points to 81.4%. Yield increased by 33.1% to HK$3.94.\\nCargo demand grew ahead of the traditional peak season in the second half of the year. In the months leading up to the end of 2021, we operated our freighter fleet at peak capacity, and supplemented our cargo capacity with additional cargo-only passenger flight operations. We also operated six of our Boeing 777-300ER passenger aircraft that have been partially converted into \\\"preighters\\\" by removing some of the seats in the passenger cabins to provide additional cargo-carrying capacity. In October, we carried more than 136,000 tonnes of cargo - the most we have carried in a single month since the start of COVID-19. Our airlines have carried more than 190 million COVID-19 vaccines since the start of COVID-19.\\nWe remained focused on effective cash and cost management. Executive pay was cut for the whole of 2021 and we introduced a third unpaid leave scheme in the first half of the year, with an 80% voluntary uptake. Employee furlough, leave without pay, voluntary separation and early retirement schemes were implemented for a broad range of employee groups, and we are extremely grateful to all of our employees who participated in such schemes. Overall, our non-fuel costs decreased by 24.4% to HK$37,708 million. Cathay Pacific's total fuel costs (before the effect of fuel hedging) increased by HK$927 million (or 11.9%) compared to 2020. This reflected increased fuel prices.\\nBusiness performance of other subsidiaries and associates\\nHK Express reported a loss of HK$1,978 million for 2021 (2020: loss of HK$1,723 million). The results were adversely affected by low demand for passenger travel and by COVID-19-related travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, including those affecting Hong Kong-based aircrew.\\nAir Hong Kong recorded a profit in 2021, benefitting from strong cargo demand. The all-cargo airline flew extra sectors for Cathay Pacific.\\nOur airline services subsidiaries' financial performance was better than in 2020.\\nAir China (accounted for three months in arrears) was adversely affected by COVID-19. Its results were worse than those in 2020.\\nFinancial position\\nThe exceptionally strong cargo performance, together with our continued focus on effective cash and cost management, had a positive impact on our monthly operating cash burn, to the extent that we were marginally cash generative in the second half of 2021.\\nAt 31st December 2021, our available unrestricted liquidity balance was HK$30.3 billion. During the year we raised HK$6.7 billion from a convertible bond issue and US$650 million (equivalent to HK$5.1 billion) from a straight bond issue under our medium-term note programme. We welcomed the Hong Kong SAR Government's agreement to extend the drawdown period of the HK$7.8 billion loan facility made available as part of our 2020 recapitalisation by 12 months to June 2022. This provides us with more flexibility to manage our liquidity position.\\nProspects\\nWe have had an extremely challenging start to 2022. Following the emergence of the Omicron variant, the HKSAR Government tightened the quarantine requirements for Hong Kong-based aircrew, notably those operating cargo flights, and temporarily banned all flights from nine countries, including the UK and the US, which are major markets for us. Passengers from high-risk places were banned from transiting through Hong Kong International Airport. All this constrained our ability to operate flights as planned. As a result, we expect to operate around 2% of pre-COVID-19 passenger flight capacity, and our cargo flight capacity is likely to remain less than one-third of pre-COVID-19 levels while current restrictions remain in place. We are trying our best to maintain our passenger and cargo networks as far as possible and will try to increase our cargo capacity as much as practicable.\\nAs Hong Kong goes through a particularly challenging phase of this pandemic, I'd like to express my empathy and concern for all the people across Hong Kong who are affected. In the early days of COVID-19, Cathay Pacific crew bravely volunteered to operate evacuation flights to bring Hong Kong people home, and during this latest phase, we are doing everything we can to support the city, bringing in vaccines, rapid antigen test kits and essential food and medical supplies, and working with the authorities to support the pandemic response.\\nAs Hong Kong's home airline, we are resolutely committed to keeping the flow of people and cargo between Hong Kong and the rest of the world safely moving, and to protecting and enhancing the city's aviation hub status despite the challenging circumstances presented by COVID-19. We have absolute confidence in the long-term future of Hong Kong. Everything we do at Cathay Pacific is in the service of Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific has been proudly serving our home city as its de facto flag carrier through thick and thin for over 75 years.\\nWe are excited by the possibilities provided by the launch of our new premium travel lifestyle brand and we will continue to launch new offers and enhancements that will give our customers more reasons to travel, to shop and to interact with us. Our commitments to sustainable aviation will continue as we strive to reach our net-zero target by 2050, and we will further build on our digital leadership capabilities. We continue to position ourselves to capitalise on the opportunities presented by the Greater Bay Area, and the growth potential afforded by the opening of the third runway at Hong Kong International Airport.\\nThough we are still facing many challenges, we have the utmost confidence in the long-term future of Cathay Pacific. We have been privileged to fly out of Hong Kong as its home airline for the past 75 years and, as those years have shown, Cathay Pacific is an enduring airline.\\nFinally, I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all of our people, who have been working tirelessly to keep the airline operating under incredibly challenging conditions. In particular, I would like to thank our aircrew, who have kept Hong Kong safely connected to the world under the most difficult conditions for any airline anywhere in the world. In 2021, our crew spent more than 62,000 nights in quarantine hotels. In addition, over 1,000 of our people, many of them aircrew, but also people from our services, operations and head office teams, have spent over 11,000 nights in the Penny's Bay quarantine facility. Collectively, our crew took over 230,000 COVID-19 tests in 2021, with only 16 positive cases despite our people, who are of course all fully vaccinated, flying continuously to many of the highest-risk countries in the world. The professionalism they have shown in upholding safe operations throughout this period have been unparalleled.\\nFor the full financial report, see\\nhttps://www.cathaypacific.com/content/dam/cx/about-us/investor-relations/announcements/en/2021_cx_annual_results_en.pdf\\nChina Eastern Airlines (SHA: 600115)\\nHeadquartered in Shanghai, China Eastern Air Holding Company (CEAH) is among China's three major air transportation groups.

Highlights of the June quarter 2022 results, including both GAAP and adjusted metrics, are on page five and are incorporated here.\\n\\\"I would like to thank our entire team for their outstanding work during a challenging operating environment for the industry as we work to restore our best-in-class reliability. Their performance coupled with strong demand drove nearly $2 billion of free cash flow as well as profitability in the first half of the year, and we are accruing profit sharing, marking a great milestone for our people,\\\" said Ed Bastian, Delta's chief executive officer. \\\"For the September quarter, we expect an adjusted operating margin of 11 to 13 percent, supporting our outlook for meaningful full year profitability.\\\"\\nJune Quarter 2022 GAAP Financial Results:\\nOperating revenue of $13.8 billion   \\nOperating income of $1.5 billion with operating margin of 11.0 percent   \\nEarnings per share of $1.15   \\nOperating cash flow of $2.5 billion   \\nTotal debt and finance lease obligations of $24.8 billion   \\nJune Quarter 2022 Adjusted Financial Results\\nOperating revenue of $12.3 billion, 99 percent recovered versus June quarter 2019 on 82 percent capacity restoration   \\nOperating income of $1.4 billion with operating margin of 11.7 percent, the first quarter of double-digit margin since 2019   \\nEarnings per share of $1.44   \\nFree cash flow of $1.6 billion after investing $864 million into the business   \\nPayments on debt and finance lease obligations of $1.0 billion   \\n$13.6 billion in liquidity* and adjusted net debt of $19.6 billion   \\nSeptember Quarter Outlook\\nFuel price guidance is based on prices as of July 8th, including Brent at $107 per barrel, cracks at $41 per barrel and $0.27 per gallon refinery contribution.\\nJune Quarter Revenue Environment and Outlook\\n\\\"With growing demand across our network in the June quarter, we recaptured higher fuel prices and delivered adjusted revenue recovery of 99 percent with unit revenues up 20.5 percent versus 2019. We also delivered another record quarter of American Express co-brand remuneration, up 35 percent from the June quarter 2019, reflecting growing brand preference and further diversification of our revenue base,\\\" said Glen Hauenstein, Delta's president. \\\"With sustained strength in bookings, we expect September quarter revenue to be up 1 to 5 percent compared to 2019 with total unit revenue growth improving sequentially.\\\"\\nDomestic continues to lead recovery with international accelerating: Domestic passenger revenue was 3 percent higher and international passenger revenue was 81 percent recovered compared to the June quarter 2019. Revenue in Latin America and Transatlantic both exceeded 2019 levels in the month of June and the pace of recovery in the Pacific saw meaningful improvement, driven by Korea and Australia re-openings and the easing of restrictions in Japan.   \\nBusiness recovery progressing: Domestic corporate sales* for the quarter were ~80 percent recovered versus 2019, up 25 points compared to the March quarter. International corporate sales* for the quarter were ~65 percent recovered versus 2019, up 30 points compared to the March quarter, driven by outsized improvement in Transatlantic.

Load factors continued to build over the quarter, reaching highs of 92% in June. The unprecedented ramp up across the aviation industry, coupled with a tight labour market, has resulted in widespread operational challenges culminating in higher levels of cancellations than normal.\\nDespite this, easyJet operated 95% of its planned schedule in Q3.\\nAction taken to remove capacity and build resilience into Q4, due to caps imposed by London Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol alongside wider challenges within Europe has resulted in July operations to date being much improved. easyJet remains focused on ensuring smooth operations this summer and will continue to fine tune our schedule if required.\\nAirline ancillary yield per passenger of \\u00a322.07 continues to outperform pre pandemic levels, up 55% on the same period in 2019. easyJet holidays generated \\u00a316m of profit in the quarter as it carried 0.4 million customers, passing its previous highest profit of \\u00a310m4 in a full year. The holidays business remains on track to carry 1.1m passengers in the full year.\\nBookings have built through the quarter as demand for easyJet's leading network remains solid. Q4 is currently 71% booked, load factor slightly ahead of 2019 and sold ticket yield is 13% above FY19.\\neasyJet is seeing yields track positively through the first half of FY23, with October half-term currently booked in line with FY19 on capacity at 95% of FY19 levels.\\nCommenting, Johan Lundgren, easyJet Chief Executive said:\\n\\\"Delivering for customers this summer remains our highest priority. During the quarter we carried seven times more customers than the same time last year and operated 95% of our schedule. We have taken action to build the additional resilience needed this summer and the operation has now normalised.\\n\\\"Despite the loss this quarter due to the short-term disruption issues, the return to flying at scale has demonstrated that the strategic initiatives launched during the pandemic are delivering now and with more\\nto come. This includes a step-change in ancillary yields, increasing 55% versus the same period in 2019, and a record profit of \\u00a316m generated in the quarter by easyJet holidays which is on track to serve 1.1 million customers in the full year.\\n\\\"easyJet expects capacity to be c.90% of Q419 across our network of major European airports, with load factors targeted above 90%.\\\"\\nCapacity\\nDuring Q3 easyJet flew 87% of FY19 capacity2, in line with the guidance and a significant increase on the same period\\nlast year where easyJet flew 16% of FY19 capacity. Load factor was 88%, as guided, due to increasing customer demand post travel restrictions easing.\\nPassenger1 numbers in the quarter increased to 22.0 million (Q3 FY21: 3.0 million).\\nFinancials\\nTotal group revenue for the quarter ending 30 June 2022 increased to \\u00a31,755 million (Q3 FY21: \\u00a3213 million). Passenger revenue increased to \\u00a31,152 million (Q3 FY21: \\u00a3152 million) and ancillary revenue increased to \\u00a3603 million (Q3 FY21: \\u00a361 million) primarily due to the increase in capacity flown. Airline ancillary revenue per seat of \\u00a319.47 (Q3 FY21: \\u00a313.14) continues to benefit from cabin bags and bundles delivering incremental revenue.\\nGroup headline costs for the quarter ending 30 June 2022 were \\u00a31,869 million (Q3 FY21: \\u00a3531 million), primarily driven by the higher level of capacity flown compared to the same period last year as well as the operational challenges seen through the period which have resulted in \\u00a3133m of disruption costs.\\nGroup headline loss before tax for the quarter ending 30 June 2022 was \\u00a3114 million, a \\u00a3204 million improvement compared to the \\u00a3318 million loss in Q3 FY21. Included in the headline loss was a \\u00a336 million loss from balance sheet FX revaluations.\\neasyJet continues to have a strong investment grade balance sheet and has one of the lowest net debts in European aviation. As at 30 June 2022, easyJet's net debt was \\u00a30.2 billion (31 March 2022: \\u00a30.6 billion) including cash and cash equivalents and money market deposits of \\u00a33.9 billion.\\nDisruption management and current operations\\nAs previously disclosed, proactive action was taken to build in additional resilience including the consolidation of capacity in Q3 and Q4, in conjunction with other measures. Given easyJet's high frequency network, over 70% of affected customers were moved onto an alternate flight within 24 hours.\\nWe believe that these capacity/cost impacts are a one-off this summer as we would expect all parties to build greater resilience in time for 2023 peak periods.\\nSlot addition\\nDuring the third quarter easyJet won 18 daily slots (9 slot pairs) at Lisbon airport, achieving growth in a highly slot constrained airport. These slots will result in easyJet becoming the second largest airline at the airport. The additional capacity enabled by the new slots will be deployed starting in October.\\nApproved aircraft purchase\\nAfter obtaining shareholder approval earlier this month, easyJet has agreed to purchase an additional 56 A320neo family aircraft for delivery between FY26 and FY29, as well as converting 18 planned deliveries of A320neo aircraft to 18 A321 neo aircraft. These aircraft will continue the modernisation of the easyJet fleet, delivering both cost and sustainability benefits to easyJet, as well as facilitating further up-gauging of the fleet.\\nSustainability\\neasyJet has signed a Letter of Intent with Airbus to support the development of carbon removal technology and to explore the opportunity to secure a future supply of carbon removal credits from direct air capture technology.\\nIn addition, easyJet and Rolls-Royce announced a ground-breaking new partnership to develop technology for hydrogen combustion engines with the potential to power narrow body aircraft. Both parties have agreed to work together on a series of engine tests on the ground starting later this year, and also have a shared ambition to take the technology to the air.\\neasyJet has committed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and we believe that zero carbon emission technology will ultimately enable us to achieve \\\"net-zero\\\" flying. easyJet remains committed to net zero and will announce its Net Zero Pathway later this year.\\nOutlook\\neasyJet currently expects capacity in Q4 to be c.90% of Q4'19 with load factors above 90%. easyJet's Q4 schedule is now 71% booked, 1ppt ahead of this point in FY19.

The Group's revenue was AED 66.2 billion (US$ 18.1 billion), an increase of 86% over last year's results. The Group's cash balance was AED 25.8 billion (US$ 7.0 billion), up 30% from last year mainly due to strong demand across its core business divisions and markets, triggered by the easing of pandemic-related restrictions.\\nHis Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates Airline and Group, said: \\\"This year, we focussed on restoring our operations quickly and safely wherever pandemic-related restrictions eased across our markets. Business recovery picked up pace particularly in the second half of the year. Robust customer demand drove a huge improvement in our financial performance compared to our unprecedented losses of last year and we built up our strong cash balance.\\n\\\"The health and safety of our people and customers remained a key priority as the world navigated its second full year of the pandemic. Across Emirates and dnata, we responded to dynamic market conditions with agility, and introduced innovative products and services to meet our customers' needs and provide them with the best possible experience.\\n\\\"2021-22 was also a significant year as the UAE marked its 50th anniversary and hosted the world at Expo 2020 Dubai which generated increased global engagement and visitation to the UAE. The Emirates Group was proud to play our part in contributing to the Expo's success and to the UAE's jubilee events.\\\"\\nIn 2021-22, Emirates received a further capital injection of AED 3.5 billion (US$ 954 million) from its ultimate shareholder, the Government of Dubai, and the Group tapped on various industry support programmes and availed a total relief of nearly AED 0.8 billion in 2021-22.\\nAs Emirates and dnata ramped up operations, employees previously on furlough or made redundant were recalled and rehired, and new recruitment drives were held to replenish the Group's talent pool and boost its future capabilities. As a result, the Group's total workforce increased by 13% to 85,219 employees, representing over 160 different nationalities.\\nIn 2021-22, the Group collectively invested AED 7.9 billion (US$ 2.2 billion) in new aircraft and facilities, and the latest technologies to position the business for recovery and future growth. It also continued to progress its environmental strategy focussed on reducing carbon emissions, consuming resources responsibly, and conserving wildlife and habitats. During the year, the Group supported community, humanitarian and philanthropic initiatives in its various markets, as well as innovation incubators, and other programmes that nurture future solutions for industry growth.\\nSheikh Ahmed said: \\\"For the Emirates Group, 2021-22 was largely about recovery, after the toughest year in our Group's history. It's not just about restoring our capacity, but also augmenting our future capabilities as we rebuild. Our aim is to build back better and stronger, so that we can deliver even better experiences to our customers and offer more support to the communities we serve.\\n\\\"We expect the Group to return to profitability in 2022-23, and are working hard to hit our targets, while keeping a close watch on headwinds such as high fuel prices, inflation, new COVID-19 variants, and political and economic uncertainty.\\n\\\"Our steady investments in infrastructure, technology, people, and partnerships, will continue to give us the ability and advantage in delivering industry-leading products and value to our customers. As Dubai and the UAE move ahead with its strategy for the next 50 years and beyond, the Emirates Group is well positioned to play our role in contributing to economic growth, facilitating global engagement, and making a positive impact on people and communities.\\\"\\nEmirates performance\\nEmirates' total passenger and cargo capacity increased by 47% to 36.4 billion ATKMs in 2021-22, as the airline continued to reinstate passenger services across its network in line with the lifting of pandemic-related flight and travel restrictions.\\nFrom 120 destinations at the start of the financial year, to increased operations and capacity growth across over 140 destinations by 31 March 2022, Emirates was able to respond dynamically to serve customer demand wherever opportunities arose, thanks to the resilience of its people and business model. In July, the airline launched a new route to Miami, bringing its total passenger gateways in the US to 12.\\nTo serve the strong rebound in travel demand, Emirates deployed its flagship A380 aircraft to even more cities during the year, bringing its A380 network to 29 destinations as of 31 March 2022.\\nHelping travellers access even more destinations, in 2021-22, Emirates reinforced its strategic partnerships with Qantas and flydubai, and expanded its interline and codeshare partnerships across Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia including with: Aeromar, airBaltic, Airlink, Azul, Cemair, Garuda Indonesia, Gulf Air, Maldivian, South African Airways and TAP Air Portugal. Emirates also signed agreements and launched initiatives with tourism partners in various destinations to support travel and tourism recovery.\\nEmirates received its final five new A380 aircraft during the financial year, all equipped with its latest cabin interiors including Premium Economy seats. It also phased out 2 older aircraft comprising of 1 Boeing 777-300ER and 1 Freighter, leaving its total fleet count at 262 at the end of March. Emirates' average fleet age remains at a youthful 8.2 years.\\nEmirates' order book of 197 aircraft remains unchanged at this time. The airline is firmly committed to its long-standing strategy of operating a modern and efficient fleet, which underscores its \\\"Fly Better\\\" brand promise, as young aircraft are better for the environment, better for operations, and better for customers.\\nWith significantly enhanced capacity deployment across most markets, Emirates' total revenue for the financial year increased 91% to AED 59.2 billion (US$ 16.1 billion). Currency fluctuations this year impacted the airline's profitability negatively by AED 348 million (US$ 95 million).\\nTotal operating costs increased by 30% from last financial year. Cost of ownership (depreciation and amortisation) and fuel cost were the two biggest cost components for the airline in 2021-22, followed by employee cost. Fuel accounted for 23% of operating costs compared to 14% in 2020-21. The airline's fuel bill more than doubled to AED 13.9 billion (US$ 3.8 billion) compared to the previous year, driven by a higher uplift of 66% in line with capacity expansion and a higher average fuel price which was up by 75%.\\nWith the removal of pandemic-related flight and travel restrictions globally, the airline managed to substantially improve its financial results and reported a loss of AED 3.9 billion (US$ 1.1 billion) after last year's AED 20.3 billion (US$ 5.5 billion) loss, and a loss margin of 6.6%, significantly improved compared to 65.6% last year.\\nEmirates carried 19.6 million passengers (up by 199%) in 2021-22, with seat capacity up by 150%. The airline reports a Passenger Seat Factor of 58.6%, compared with last year's passenger seat factor of 44.3%; and a 10% decline in passenger yield to 35.1 fils (9.6 US cents) per Revenue Passenger Kilometre (RPKM), due to the change in route mix, fares and currency. Seat load factor and yield results cannot be compared against the previous year's performance due to the ongoing unusual pandemic situation.\\nEmirates continued to invest in its products and services to deliver ever better customer experiences. This year, it announced a major retrofit programme to equip 120 of its 777 and A380 aircraft with its new Premium Economy seats and the latest cabin interiors.\\nIt also accelerated digital initiatives to provide customers with smoother and safer journeys, from the quick and secure verification of COVID-19 travel documents, to more biometrics and contactless touchpoints at its Dubai hub.\\nEmirates continued to lead the industry with initiatives that provide customer assurance as travel restrictions eased and more people made travel plans. It extended its generous rebooking waivers and complimentary COVID-19 medical cover for all customers; and introduced new ways for Emirates Skywards members to earn Miles while extending the expiry of miles and tier status.\\nIn this 2nd pandemic year, Emirates SkyCargo once again put in a stellar performance and contributed to 40% of the airline's total transport revenue through its ability to respond rapidly to changing demand patterns in a distorted global marketplace.\\nEmirates SkyCargo maintained its edge in the global airfreight industry by focusing its customers, bringing innovative solutions to the market, and leveraging its fleet and network capabilities.\\nRebuilding its network and capacity, the cargo division intelligently deployed its freighter fleet and belly-hold capacity, to meet customer needs. By 30 June 2021, it had restored services to over 90% of its pre-pandemic network.\\nDuring the year, Emirates SkyCargo continued to play an important role in getting COVID-19 vaccines and other medical supplies to communities around the world, and keeping trade lanes open for food supplies, e-commerce and other essential goods. In June 2021, it invested to scale up its pharma cool chain infrastructure in Dubai and by March 2022, Emirates SkyCargo had transported 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines.\\nAt the Dubai Airshow 2021, Emirates announced a US$ 1 billion investment to acquire 2 new Boeing 777 freighters and convert 4 existing 777-300ER aircraft into freighters.\\nWith steady and strong air freight demand throughout the year, Emirates' cargo division reported a new record revenue of AED 21.7 billion (US$ 5.9 billion), an increase of 27% over last year.\\nFreight yield per Freight Tonne Kilometre (FTKM) decreased by 3% as more cargo capacity returned to the global market, but generally remained at high levels compared to the pandemic marketplace due to steady and strong demand.\\nTonnage carried increased by 14% to reach 2.1 million tonnes, due to the growth in available bellyhold capacity for the entire year with the reinstatement of more passenger services. At the end of 2021-22, Emirates' SkyCargo's total freighter fleet stood at 10 Boeing 777Fs.\\nEmirates' hotels portfolio doubled revenue over last year to AED 602 million (US$ 164 million) as it re-opened more facilities to serve the upswing in tourism traffic and the gradual recovery of the meetings and conferences industry.\\nDuring the year, Emirates successfully restructured and extended various aircraft leases. The support from aviation lessors and financing partners during these challenging times reflect the financial community's confidence in Emirates' business model, and its mid to longer term prospects.\\nIn addition to the AED 9.7 billion (US$ 2.6 billion) financing that was raised for aircraft and general corporate purposes in 2021-22, Emirates has already received committed offers to finance two aircraft deliveries due in 2022-23.\\nEmirates closed the financial year with solid cash assets of AED 20.9 billion (US$ 5.7 billion), 38% higher compared to 31 March 2021.\\ndnata performance\\nRecovery from the pandemic was felt across all dnata businesses, and in 2021-22 dnata returned to profitability with a profit of AED 110 million (US$ 30 million).\\nWith growing flight and travel activity across the world, dnata's total revenue increased by 54% to AED 8.6 billion (US$ 2.3 billion). dnata's international business accounts for 62% of its revenue.\\ndnata continued to lay the foundations for future growth with investments in 2021-22 amounting to AED 370 million (US$ 101 million).\\nDuring the year, dnata invested significantly in its cargo handling capabilities. It expanded existing facilities in Sydney, Australia; opened a state-of-the-art cargo centre at London Heathrow airport; and announced a fully automated cargo centre to be built at 'dnata Cargo City' at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. It also introduced an advanced \\\"OneCargo\\\" system which digitises and automates business and operational functions at its Iraq cargo operations, with plans to roll out the system across its global cargo network.\\nIn 2021-22, dnata's operating costs increased by 14% to AED 8.4 billion (US$ 2.3 billion), in line with expanded operations in its Airport Operations, Catering and Travel divisions across the world.\\ndnata's cash balance improved by AED 208 million to AED 4.9 billion (US$ 1.3 billion). Net cash used in financing activities, primarily payments for loans and leases, amounted to AED 745 million (US$ 203 million), while the business utilised net cash of AED 246 million (US$ 67 million) in essential investing activities. The business saw a positive operating cash flow of AED 1.2 billion (US$ 332 million) in 2021-22, a reflection of the substantial improvements in revenues.\\nRevenue from dnata's Airport Operations, including ground and cargo handling increased to AED 5.7 billion (US$ 1.6 billion).\\nThe number of aircraft turns handled by dnata globally grew by 82% to 527,501, cargo handled increased by 10% to 3.0 million tonnes, reflecting the increase in flight activity across the globe as dnata's customers re-started their operations wherever market restrictions on flights and travel were lifted.\\nDuring 2021-22, dnata expanded its global airport operations footprint into Africa. It signed a concession agreement with The Government of Zanzibar, where dnata will oversee the operations of the island's newly-built international terminal with its partners, including Emirates Leisure Retail (ELR) who will partner with MMI as master concessionaire for all food and beverage, duty free and commercial outlets at the terminal.\\nmarhaba, dnata's airport hospitality brand, marked its 30th year of operations with the launch of its signature meet and greet services at four of Australia's major airports, a new lounge in Zurich Airport, and a re-designed experience at its flagship lounge at Dubai International.\\ndnata's Catering business accounted for AED 1.7 billion (US$ 455 million) of dnata's revenue, up by 60%. The inflight catering business uplifted 39.9 million meals to airline customers, more than double the number of meals from last year, as its airline customers across the world restored their flight operations.\\nSignificant customer wins during the year include BA CityFlyer, which led to dnata Catering launching operations at London City Airport; and the global inflight retail services contract for easyJet where dnata's team of inflight retail experts will develop and manage bespoke onboard retail programmes and solutions for the airline.\\nIt also saw significant activity in Australia. As the country re-opened its borders to international travellers, dnata worked closely with airline customers to support their resumption of flight operations. dnata Catering also continued to grow its retail food business with ready-made meals developed by Snapfresh Australia launched in Aldi and Costco stores nationwide.\\nRevenue from dnata's Travel Services division has significantly grown by 434% to AED 694 million (US$ 189 million). The reported total transaction value (TTV) of travel services sold increased by 912% to AED 2.3 billion (US$ 632 million), a dramatic reversal from last year. These increases reflect last year's abnormal situation where the business saw high levels of COVID-19-related booking cancellations.\\nDuring the year, dnata introduced several new products and services in the UAE, capitalising on its market expertise, Dubai's open borders for international travel, the city's hosting of Expo 2020 as well as other major conferences and sporting events.\\nFor its corporate travel customers, dnata partnered with ExpensePoint to offer an advanced expense reporting solution; renewed a partnership with one of the world's largest VAT reclaim specialists that will bring additional saving opportunities for duty travel claims; and implemented hybrid meetings and events solutions to provide customers a sustainable alternative to hosting corporate engagements during lockdown.\\nIn the UK, dnata's Travel Republic brand introduced a new 'Secure Trust Account' for package holiday customers that guarantees prompt refunds for customers who have to cancel their flight-inclusive package holiday, as funds are kept secure in a separate account.\\ndnata also launched its Gold Medal brand in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia this year, offering its extensive portfolio of travel products to independent travel agents.\\nhttps://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-group-announces-2021-22-results/\\nEtihad Airways\\nEtihad Airways is the second flag carrier of the United Arab Emirates.

This included its best monthly results to date for February, prior to the impact of COVID-19, the subsequent closure of international borders, and the suspension of flights to and from the UAE from 24 March.\\nH1 2020 performance\\nEtihad carried 3.5 million passengers in H1 (H1 2019: 8.2 million), a reduction of 58% from the same period the previous year. Average seat load factor was 71%. Core operating loss for this period increased by US$ 172 million to US$ 758 million (H1 2019: US$ 586 million), driven by a 38% drop in revenues, which stood at US$ 1.7 billion (H1 2019: US$ 2.7bn). This was partially offset by a 27% reduction in direct operating costs to US$ 1.9 billion (H1 2019: US$ 2.7 billion), and a 21% reduction in general and administrative expenses to US$ 0.40 billion (H1 2019: US$ 0.50), both driven by management cost containment initiatives and reduced operations. Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) reduced by 53% to 23.69 billion (H1 2019: 50.35 billion).\\nCargo revenues were US$ 0.49 billion, an improvement of US$ 130 million (37%) compared to the same period in 2019, with 254,345 leg tonnes of cargo carried. This was driven by an increase in demand and a spike in cargo fares.\\nThe core operating result for the first three months of the year improved by 34%, despite the onset of COVID-19, with a 12% reduction in passenger numbers, and a 9.5% reduction in ASK. Q1 seat load factor was 74% (January's performance was significantly stronger than the same month in 2019, with a seat load factor of 81.9%), and yield at US$ 5.92 cents. Unit revenue in Q1 reduced by 3.3% to US$ 4.14 cents (Q1 2019: US$ 4.28 cents), offset by continuous focus on driving down unit costs, which were reduced by 2.4% to US$ 7.01 cents (Q1 US$ 7.18 cents).\\nHowever, the airline saw a significant decrease in Q2 operating revenues following COVID-19 flight suspensions, with 70% of its fleet grounded. This period registered a 99% drop in passenger numbers and a 95% drop in ASK compared to Q2 2019. Seat load factor for this period was 16%, mainly driven by the operation of special (repatriation) flights, and the resumption of a limited network of transfer services via Abu Dhabi in early June.\\nTony Douglas, Group Chief Executive Officer, Etihad Aviation Group, said: \\\"Etihad faced a set of enormous and unpredictable challenges in the first six months of the year. We started 2020 strong and recorded encouraging results as part of our continuing transformation programme. This left us in a relatively robust position when COVID-19 hit, allowing us to act with agility, and to mobilise all available resources as the crisis deepened, taking major steps to reduce costs through a wide-reaching series of measures.\\n\\\"While we have revised our outlook for the rest of 2020 based on current realities, we remain optimistic that as international borders re-open, we will increase our flying and carry more guests securely and with greater peace of mind, supported by the Etihad Wellness programme and our new Wellness Ambassadors. By September, we aim to increase our worldwide flights to half our pre-COVID-19 capacity. Looking forward, we rest assured that the UAE is leading the way in the research for a vaccine against COVID-19. The incredible efforts Abu Dhabi is making to ensure the safety and security of its residents and visitors will soon enable us to welcome the world back to our amazing home. This commitment was successfully highlighted by the recent hosting of major UFC events in the capital.\\\"\\nEtihad operated up to 40 of its fleet of 97 passenger aircraft in Q2, including Boeing 787 Dreamliner, 777-300ERs, and Airbus A320 family aircraft as belly-hold cargo freighters to complement Etihad Cargo's operational fleet of six 777-200F freighters. Between 25 March and 15 June, over 640 special passenger flights were operated to 45 online and offline destinations, using the passenger cabins of these aircraft to fly foreign nationals out of the UAE, and to bring UAE nationals back home.\\nAdam Boukadida, Chief Financial Officer, Etihad Aviation Group, said: \\\"This year started strong, riding on the positive momentum gained in 2019, and by the end of the first quarter, the airline was on track to achieve a 2020 EBITDA of US$ 900 million (2019: US$ 453 million). Etihad managed to maintain a satisfactory level of liquidity despite a major drop in revenues, while continuing to raise new liquidity facilities supported by local and international financial institutions. This was supported by maintaining an 'A with a stable outlook' Fitch rating in April, at the height of the pandemic. Etihad was one of a small number of airlines to maintain its pre-COVID-19 credit rating.\\n\\\"A greater emphasis is being placed on a drive towards increased cost optimisation and efficiencies across the entire business to face the hurdles placed in our way by COVID-19. Our suppliers and partners have also worked closely with us, including the arrangement of payment holidays with lessors and savings discussions with all of our supply chain, so we can re-emerge stronger together.\\\"\\nNetwork\\nEtihad is gradually resuming services to more destinations across its global network. This follows the easing of travel restrictions by UAE regulatory authorities on outbound and inbound travel for citizens and residents. All travel remains subject to the entry and health regulations set by the UAE authorities, and those at the end destination.\\nThroughout August and September, subject to the lifting of international restrictions and the re-opening of individual markets, the airline aims to fly to 61 destinations worldwide from its Abu Dhabi hub, operating approximately 50 per cent of its pre-COVID capacity.\\nSubject to the applicable government approvals, Etihad's summer schedule will feature a wider network and increased frequencies to the following destinations from, to, or via Abu Dhabi:\\nMiddle East & Africa: Amman, Bahrain, Beirut, Cairo, Casablanca, Dammam, Jeddah, Kuwait, Muscat, Rabat, Riyadh, Seychelles Europe: Amsterdam, Athens, Barcelona, Belgrade, Brussels, Dublin, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Geneva, Istanbul, London Heathrow, Madrid, Manchester, Milan, Moscow, Munich, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Rome, Zurich Asia: Ahmedabad, Baku, Bangkok, Bengaluru, Chennai, Colombo, Delhi, Hyderabad, Islamabad, Jakarta, Karachi, Kochi, Kolkata, Kozhikode, Kuala Lumpur, Lahore, Male, Manila, Mumbai, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Thiruvananthapuram, Tokyo Australasia: Melbourne, Sydney North America: Chicago, New York JFK, Toronto, Washington, D.C.\\nEtihad Wellness\\nTo protect its customers, Etihad launched 'Etihad Wellness', a comprehensive health and hygiene programme, building on the stringent measures already put in place to deal with COVID-19, and which is now a major component of the airline's long-term customer strategy. The launch of the programme was championed by the introduction of specially trained Wellness Ambassadors, a first in the industry, who provide essential travel health information and care online via webchat, at Abu Dhabi International Airport, and in-flight, so guests can fly with greater peace of mind.\\nThe global response to many aspects of the programme, including the game-changing Wellness Ambassadors and wide-ranging travel health and hygiene protocols, has been overwhelmingly positive. The airline is taking the opportunity to develop Etihad Wellness as a key differentiator for customers when purchasing a premium product which can guarantee them genuine care and effective health and safety measures, and deliver a world-leading service and hospitality offering.\\nEtihad Wellness initiatives are being communicated through an easy-to-use online guide focusing on the high standards of cleanliness, and health and hygiene being applied at every stage of the customer journey. This includes culinary hygiene at the airline's catering facilities and food testing laboratory, aircraft cabin deep-cleaning, check-in, health screening, boarding, inflight experience and product, crew interaction, arrival, and ground transportation.\\nIn June, Etihad also launched a partnership with Austria-based healthcare technology company, Medicus AI, to launch a COVID-19 risk-assessment tool that will empower guests to make informed decisions about travelling.\\nWorkforce\\nCOVID-19 has brought unprecedented challenges for all airlines, with demand for travel significantly reduced, and Etihad continues to do all it can to support its world-class family of employees during this difficult period. However, due to the severity of the situation facing the industry, the airline has been forced to redesign the organization around the need to make redundancies from its workforce across several areas of the business to ensure future continuity. Temporary company-wide salary sacrifices of 25% to 50% were also introduced.\\nMr. Douglas adds: \\\"Etihad, like all major airlines, has had no choice but to embrace the ambiguity of the situation it has been thrown into, and with much sadness, we have had to make some extremely difficult decisions to reduce the size of the workforce by several thousand. Those who have departed Etihad have done so with incredible dignity and their contribution has been immeasurable.\\n\\\"We are tremendously proud of each member of the Etihad family, every one of whom has gone above and beyond in extremely difficult conditions to keep Etihad's image held high, while maintaining superior levels of service. Etihad flew into the COVID-19 era with uncertainty but is re-emerging resilient, if a little battle-scarred, with a renewed focus on its core values. We are retraining our people throughout the organization to deliver a new product for a new reality, based on the development and delivery of Etihad Wellness well into the foreseeable future.\\\"\\nHumanitarian flights\\nEtihad and Etihad Cargo operated special humanitarian services to 60 cities around the world, 40 of which are not currently served by the airline's passenger or cargo network of flights. These included Addis Ababa, Antananarivo, Auckland, Bamako, Banjul, Barbados, Bhubaneswar, Bishkek, Bogota, Bucharest, Buenos Aires, Conakry, Dushanbe, Erbil, Freetown, Grozny, Harare, Havana, Kabul, Kiev, Kinshasa, Kish Island, Larnaca, Lima, Lucknow, Makhachkala, Moroni, N'Djamena, Niamey, Nouakchott, Podgorica, San Jose, Santiago, Santo Domingo, Sofia, Tirana, Wuhan, Yerevan, and Zagreb.\\nExtensive maintenance program\\nWith most of its passenger aircraft on the ground throughout April, May and June, Etihad embarked on the biggest aircraft maintenance program in its history. The airline's MRO division, Etihad Engineering, performed maintenance work on 97 passenger aircraft including 29 Airbus A320 and A321s, 10 Airbus A380s, 39 Boeing 787s, and 19 Boeing 777-300ERs. This ranged from minor maintenance tasks, such as seat repairs and updates to inflight entertainment systems, to bringing forward scheduled engine changes and modifications on several aircraft, reducing the need to withdraw them from service when scheduled services resumed. The extensive program was additional to the routine maintenance which is carried out at regular intervals.\\nSustainability\\nEtihad continues to be a leader, together with its partners in the UAE and around the world, in pioneering new and effective ways of mitigating aviation's environmental impact. The sustainability strategy of the Etihad Aviation Group is aligned to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. In January, in the presence of the EU Commission Etihad announced our commitment of zero net carbon Emissions by 2050 and halving of 2019 emissions by 2035.\\nFollowing the launch of the Greenliner programme in partnership with Boeing in November 2019, Etihad in January took delivery of a specially branded Boeing 787-10 aircraft, wearing a special 'green' livery to highlight its role in sustainability research activities, to drive innovation and sustainability into the operational space. To celebrate Ireland's National Day, Etihad deployed the Greenliner from Abu Dhabi to Dublin. An optimised route profile reduced the journey time by 40 minutes, cut fuel by 800kgs, and CO2 by three tonnes.\\nIn the same month, when Etihad announced its sustainability commitments in Brussels, the airline operated a Boeing 787 EcoFlight from Abu Dhabi to the home of the EU. The flight had an optimised routing by Eurocontrol; minimum single use plastics; and other fuel efficiency initiatives including the use of electric tractors at the Abu Dhabi hub, reducing APU usage, and optimizing potable water levels.\\n\\\"The clear focus moving forward is on adapting our transformation plan to reflect new market conditions, but without changing our overall objectives or sustainability goals and commitments. We anticipate some continued volatility for a while to come, as the world strives to put an end to COVID-19, and as testing methodologies and protocols evolve to become the new norm.\\n\\\"We know that markets are certain to rebound and the world will rediscover the wonder of flying once more. When it does, our guests will value the Etihad Wellness proposition more than ever, and we are best positioned to deliver the security, assurance, and best-in-class experience they have come to expect from Etihad as a true full-service airline\\\", concludes Mr. Douglas.\\nhttps://www.etihad.com/en/news/etihad-airways-reports-strong-start-to-2020-with-second-quarter-heavily-impacted-by-covid-19\\nEVA Air (TPE: 2618)\\nEva Air is a subsidiary of the privately held Evergreen Group.\\nCompany History\\n2020\\nAirlineRatings.com recognized EVA the 3rd of \\\"World's Top 20 Safest Airlines\\\".   \\nEVA was recognized the 9th of \\\"World's Safest Airlines\\\" by AERO International, a magazine in Germany.   \\n2019\\nTripAdvisor recognized EVA \\\"Best Airline in Asia\\\", \\\"Best Business Class in Asia\\\", \\\"Best Premium Economy Class in Asia\\\" and 3rd of \\\"World's Best Airlines\\\".   \\nEVA recognized as \\\"The Best Business Class Onboard Amenities Kit (Georg Jensen)\\\", \\\"The Best Business Class Onboard Amenities Kit (Salvatore Ferragamo)\\\", \\\"The Best Premium Economy Class Onboard Amenities Kit (Sport b.)\\\", \\\"The Best Economy Class Onboard Textiles\\\" by Onboard Hospitality, a transportation magazine of U.K. PAX International, a Canadian professional aviation magazine, awarded EVA \\\"Asia Best Economy Class Amenity Kit (Sport b.)\\\".

Finnair also offers package tours under its Aurinkomatkat-Suntours and Finnair Holidays brands.\\nFinnair's vision is to shape the wonders of travel with passengers. Finnair's mission is to inspire passengers to effortlessly connect and experience the world in a more sustainable way. Helsinki's geographical location gives Finnair a competitive advantage since the fastest connections between many European destinations and Asian megacities fly over Finland.\\nFinnair has a stable position in the domestic market and it is poised to benefit from expected growth in Asian markets. Finnair aims to deliver value to its shareholders by focusing on its core business and businesses close to it, and by investing in its competitiveness and growth.\\nFinnair has a clear strategy for reaching its goals. The foundation for the strategy is seen in the high quality of its operations, Helsinki's favorable geographic position, growing focus markets, clear goals to increase revenue, modern fuel-efficient fleet as well as a strong balance sheet.\\nFinnair is listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki Mid Cap list.\\nSustainable profitable growth\\nFollowing a period of accelerated growth, Finnair is now moving into a new phase. The company seeks to grow in line with the market, targeting sustainable and profitable growth.\\nFinnair's Board of Directors has defined the following targets for the 2020-2025 strategy period:\\nComparable EBIT of over 7.5% over the cycle (at constant fuel and currency)   \\nROCE of over 10% over the cycle (at constant fuel and currency)   \\nOn-time-performance of over 85%   \\nImproved Net Promoter Score and improved employee Net promoter score   \\nCarbon neutrality by the end of 2045 and a 50 per cent net carbon reduction by the end of 2025 compared to the 2019 level   \\nFinnair aims to deliver these targets through a focused strategy that leverages the geographical advantage of Finnair's hub in connecting Europe and Asia. Due to the COVID-19-pandemic, Finnair is assessing its financial targets and the schedule for reaching them, taking into account the assumption of the company's management that the traffic is expected to recover in 2-3 years on the 2019 level. The financial targets, the timing for their implementation, or both may be amended depending on the length and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nAdditional guidance for the 2020-2025 strategy period includes the following indicative items:\\nCapacity growth, measured in Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) of 3-5% CAGR   \\nOptimize liquidity, yet keeping cash to sales ratio above 15%   \\nGearing ratio 175% at maximum   \\nAssess renewal and downsizing of the hybrid bond   \\nIncrease the share of owned aircraft vs. leased aircraft   \\nKeep the dividend policy unchanged   \\nDividend policy\\nThe aim of Finnair's dividend policy is to pay, on average, at least one-third of the earnings per share as a dividend during an economic cycle. The aim is to take into account the company's earnings trend and outlook, financial situation and capital needs in the distribution of dividends.\\nhttps://investors.finnair.com/en/finnair-as-an-investment?_ga=2.145176692.1596177746.1590133959-941304950.1590133959\\n27 April 2023\\nFinnair Group Interim Report 1 January - 31 March 2023\\nStrong demand and well-progressed strategy implementation led to break-even result during seasonally weakest quarter.\\nJanuary - March 2023\\nEarnings per share were -0.01 euros (-0.15)*.   \\nRevenue increased by 73.8% to 694.7 million euros (399.8).   \\nComparable operating result was 0.9 million euros (-132.9).

They are part of the Group's liquidity management.\\nCEO Topi Manner\\nThe year started on a positive note, as Finnair achieved a marginally positive comparable operating result in the seasonally weakest first quarter. This was the third consecutive profitable quarter after ten loss-making quarters caused by the pandemic and the closure of Russian airspace. Typically, the first quarter of the year is loss-making and, thus, the result speaks of both good progress in strategy implementation, and of a strong demand environment. Strong demand, combined with capacity and resource constraints in the aviation sector caused by the pandemic, contributed to the positive development of our unit revenues.\\nWe are heading in the right direction, but the road to recovery is a long one. We cannot expect that the current strong demand situation is a permanent one. Our operating environment remains challenging in many respects, as the fuel price has remained high, inflation has not subsided, interest rates have risen, and the Russian airspace remains closed as the war in Ukraine continues. Therefore, we are determined to continue implementing our strategy, seeking both an increase in unit revenue, and a reduction in unit costs, in order to be able to achieve our financial targets in a normalised demand and capacity environment.\\nFinnair now has a more geographically balanced network. Although the closure of Russian airspace has reduced traffic to Asia and travel to China is only starting to increase, Finnair's position in traffic between Europe and Asia has remained strong. At the same time, we have found new passenger flows in long-distance traffic, for example, in traffic between the United States and Europe, India and the United States, and the Middle East and Northern Europe. Brisk travel within Europe has also continued. Leisure travel has returned to the pre-pandemic level, and the recovery of business travel continues.\\nDuring the quarter, we signed a new agreement with our Finland-based cabin crew to support productivity enhancement and enable savings. As a result, almost 90 per cent of Finnair's personnel have agreed on savings to nurse the company back to health. We have also made changes to the service concept on our flights, reducing unit costs. As part of our sustainability work, we purchased the largest single batch of sustainable aviation fuel from Neste to date, 750 tonnes. While this represents only a small portion of our current fuel consumption, it is a meaningful step in our long-term journey to scale up sustainable aviation fuel usage.\\nOur on-time performance during the first quarter was 82 per cent. Customers have been satisfied with Finnair's service, as our net promoter score was 42. I would like to thank the entire Finnair team for their good customer care and systematic implementation of the strategy during the quarter.\\nWe are now preparing for the busy summer season. We have strengthened our resources by recruiting pilots and hiring seasonal workers for cabin service through a partner. Thanks to our strong team and well-functioning home base Helsinki Airport, we are in an excellent position to serve our customers during the upcoming peak travel season.\\nOutlook\\nGUIDANCE ISSUED ON 15 FEBRUARY 2023:\\nFinnair estimates that in 2023, it will operate an average capacity of 80-85 per cent, as measured in ASKs, compared to 2019. The capacity is impacted by the development of demand, e.g., increase in travel on Chinese routes, and potential leases of aircraft with crew to other airlines.\\nFinnair estimates that the strong demand for travel will continue in the short-term, supporting its unit revenues as in the second half of 2022, but the continuing general economic uncertainty will weaken the visibility of travel demand development during 2023. With the fading impacts of the pandemic following the opening of China, Finnair expects normal seasonality to return. Accordingly, the first quarter of the year is seasonally the weakest and results typically in negative EBIT, while the summer months are the high season in travel.\\nSignificant uncertainty in Finnair's operating environment continues, as the price of fuel is high and the length of the Russian airspace closure and the impact of inflation on demand and costs are unclear.\\nFinnair estimates that its 2023 revenue will significantly increase year-on-year, especially as the first half of 2022 was heavily burdened by both the pandemic and the closed Russian airspace. Nonetheless, the company estimates that its revenue will not yet reach the level of 2019.\\nFinnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the Q1 2023 interim report.\\nNEW GUIDANCE ON 27 April 2023:\\nFinnair reiterates its guidance, estimating that in 2023, it will operate an average capacity of 80-85 per cent, as measured in ASKs, compared to 2019. The capacity is impacted by the development of demand, e.g., increase in travel on Chinese routes, and potential leases of aircraft with crew to other airlines.\\nFinnair estimates that the strong demand for travel will continue, supporting its unit revenues, but the continuing general economic uncertainty weakens the visibility on travel demand development after the summer season 2023. The summer months are the high season in travel, whereas demand typically weakens towards the end of the year, based on normal seasonality.\\nSignificant uncertainty in Finnair's operating environment continues. The price of fuel is high, and the end of the Russian airspace closure is not in sight. Further, the extent of the impacts of inflation and rising interest rates on demand and costs is uncertain.\\nFinnair estimates that its 2023 revenue will significantly increase and comparable EBIT will significantly improve year-on-year, especially as the first half of 2022 was heavily burdened by both the pandemic and the closed Russian airspace.

That year, thousands gathered in Honolulu to witness the departure of Hawaii's first scheduled inter-island flights to Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii. The fleet was comprised of two eight-passenger Sikorsky S-38 amphibian planes; six years later, larger 16-passenger Sikorsky S-43s were added to accommodate increased traffic and newly authorized inter-island airmail service.\\nhttps://www.hawaiianairlines.com/about-us/history\\n25 April 2023\\nHawaiian Holdings Reports 2023 First Quarter Financial Results\\nHawaiian Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: HA) (the \\\"Company\\\"), parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (\\\"Hawaiian\\\"), today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2023.\\n\\\"A big mahalo to our team who continue to make us a stronger, better airline. The demand for leisure travel remains strong in the domestic markets we serve, and we see similar conditions in most of our international markets,\\\" said Hawaiian Airlines President and CEO Peter Ingram . \\\"In recent days, our team completed a significant technology initiative, one of many projects underway in 2023 that position us for a bright future. We look forward to sustaining momentum on these initiatives and returning Hawaiian to profitability.\\\"\\nStatistical data, as well as a reconciliation of the reported non-GAAP financial measures, can be found in the accompanying tables.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had:\\nUnrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.4 billion   \\n$1.6 billion in liquidity, including its undrawn $235 million revolving credit facility   \\nOutstanding debt and finance lease obligations of $1.7 billion   \\nRevenue Environment\\nHawaiian benefited from continued robust leisure demand from North America to Hawai\\u02bbi and the restoration of its international network excluding Japan . International traffic was buoyed by strong U.S. point of sale activity. Demand remained strong for premium products both domestically and internationally. The Company's overall operating revenue for the first quarter 2023 was up 28.4% from the first quarter 2022 on 15.4% higher capacity as Hawaiian recovered from the effects of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which impacted results in the first quarter 2022.\\nOther revenue was down 12.4% compared to the first quarter of 2022 driven by a decrease in cargo revenue.\\nOperational Environment\\nSeveral challenges continued to negatively affect the environment in which the Company operates. Constraints on the availability of A321 aircraft due to Pratt & Whitney engine delays, ongoing runway construction at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu (\\\"HNL\\\"), and delays related to air traffic control protocols disrupted Hawaiian's on-time performance, impaired its scheduling, and adversely affected its financial results.\\nLimitations on Hawaiian's A321 fleet availability necessitated the substitution of A330 aircraft, which are less fuel efficient, on some A321 routes. Fuel consumption for the first quarter 2023 was up 21.4% as compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to higher capacity and inefficiencies resulting from these challenges.\\nFirst Quarter 2023 Highlights\\nTechnology Advancement\\nTransitioned its Passenger Service System to Amadeus' Altea platform marking a significant information technology (\\\"IT\\\") accomplishment for the Company in April; this new platform will enable the Company to be more commercially and operationally nimble   \\nRoutes and Network\\nOperated at 115% of its 2022 first quarter capacity, comprised of 98%, 119%, and 275% capacity on its North America, Neighbor Island and International routes, respectively   \\nAnnounced an increase in summer weekly frequencies between Honolulu and Austin, Boston , Las Vegas , and Pago Pago in preparation for strong summer demand to Hawai'i as well as a fourth daily flight between Honolulu and Los Angeles twice per week   \\nAnnounced resumption of service between Honolulu and Fukuoka beginning April 28 with thrice-weekly service   \\nGuest Experience\\nStreamlined the Honolulu travel experience with the opening of a new TSA security checkpoint at HNL, which added 1,000 square feet for passenger queuing and 3,000 square feet of screening area; expanded screening capacity alleviates congestion and benefits all guests whether they are flying to a neighbor island or boarding a transpacific flight   \\nPeople\\nReceived ratification by Hawaiian's pilots represented by the Air Line Pilots Association of a four-year contract that provides for pay scale increases across all fleet types, improved health benefits, a signing bonus, and cost sharing, and enhancements to the postretirement and disability plans for more than 1,000 employees   \\nFormed a partnership with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's Aviation Maintenance Technology SkillBridge program which provides an opportunity for veterans to bridge the transition into the civilian aviation and aerospace sector   \\nEstablished a $100,000 scholarship fund in partnership with Arizona State University's W.P.

We continue to capitalise on surges in bookings when travel restrictions are lifted.\\n\\\"All our airlines have shown improvements with the Group's operating loss more than halved compared to previous quarters. In Q3, our operating cash flow was positive for the first time since the start of the pandemic and our liquidity is higher than ever, reaching \\u20ac12.1 billion on a pro forma basis at the end of October.\\n\\\"The full reopening of the transatlantic travel corridor from Monday is a pivotal moment for our industry. British Airways is serving more US destinations than any transatlantic carrier and we're delighted that we can get our customers flying again.\\n\\\"Longhaul traffic has been a significant driver of revenue, with bookings recovering faster than shorthaul as we head into the winter. Premium leisure is performing strongly at both Iberia and British Airways and there are early signs of a recovery in business travel.\\n\\\"Iberia and Vueling continued to be the best performers within the Group in the third quarter. Iberia returned to profitability while Vueling reached breakeven at the operating level. Both seized opportunities to strengthen their positions on routes to Latin America and the Spanish domestic market.\\n\\\"In the short term, we are focused on getting ready to operate as much capacity as we can and ensuring IAG is set up to return to profitability in 2022. Our teams are creating opportunities and implementing initiatives to transform our business and preparing it for the future so that we emerge more competitive. This includes initiatives such as our new shorthaul operation at Gatwick, Vueling's expansion at Paris-Orly, Aer Lingus' services from Manchester to the US and the Caribbean and our new maintenance model in Barcelona.\\n\\\"We also remain resolute in our climate commitments. We're transforming our business and driving change to create a truly sustainable airline industry. IAG has led the way by being the first airline group worldwide to commit to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and we welcome IATA's recent announcement that the industry will join us in meeting this goal.\\\"\\nTrading outlook\\nAt current fuel prices and exchange rates, IAG expects its 2021 operating loss before exceptional items to be approximately \\u20ac3.0 billion. Quarter 4 capacity, measured in ASKs, is expected to be approximately 60% of 2019, resulting in 2021 capacity of 37% of the 2019 level.\\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\\nALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES\\nAll figures in the tables below are before exceptional items.\\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\\nCOVID-19 Summary - Nine months to September 30, 2021\\nThe Group's results continue to be impacted by COVID-19 and the related restrictions on travel. A detailed review of the impact of COVID-19 on the Group in 2020 was provided in the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts and this review provides an update for the first nine months of 2021.\\nIn the first half of 2021, due to the continuing impact of the virus worldwide and the associated travel and border restrictions applying in many countries, the Group was only able to operate a limited passenger schedule, with capacity operated only 20.8 per cent of that operated in 2019. Passenger capacity for quarter 2 was 21.9 per cent of 2019, up marginally on the 19.6 per cent operated in quarter 1, with an increase in capacity during the quarter where travel restrictions allowed. Capacity was increased to 43.4 per cent of 2019 in quarter 3, linked to a partial easing of restrictions. The Group operated 3,334 additional cargo-only flights, leading to record cargo revenue for the nine months.\\nThe Group seeks to reduce the impact of volatile commodity prices by hedging fuel purchases in advance, based on expected capacity levels. The Group also hedges foreign exchange rates. The impact of COVID-19 has led to a significant reduction in the requirement to purchase jet fuel, due to the significantly reduced flying programme. As a consequence, the Group has derivative contracts for which there was no corresponding purchase of jet fuel, leading to discontinuance of hedge accounting for these fuel derivatives, together with the related foreign exchange derivatives. In aggregate there is a net loss on these derivative contracts as, whilst the commodity fuel price has risen in recent months, the average fuel price over the period covered by these contracts was significantly below levels seen before COVID-19, when these derivative contracts were taken out. The exceptional credit in the nine months is mainly due to the reversal of prior year charges resulting from reduced losses (compared to previously forecast) on these contracts, due to rising fuel prices in 2021, net of an adjustment for the latest assessment of capacity for 2021 and foreign exchange movements.\\nIn May 2021, the Board approved a revised fuel hedging policy, which is designed to provide flexibility to respond to both significant unexpected reductions in travel demand or capacity and/or material or sudden changes in jet fuel prices. The revised policy allows for differentiation within the Group, to match the nature of each operating company, and a greater use of call options. The revised policy will operate on a two-year rolling basis, with hedging up to 60 per cent of anticipated requirements in the first twelve months and up to 30 per cent in the following twelve months and with flexibility for low-cost airlines within the Group to adopt hedging up to 75 per cent in the first twelve months. For all Group airlines, hedging between 25 and 36 months ahead will only be undertaken in exceptional circumstances.\\nThe Group continues to take action to preserve cash and boost liquidity. In the nine months the Group drew debt facilities agreed in 2020, namely a \\u00a32.0 billion Export Development Guarantee (EDG) term loan for British Airways from UK Export Finance and \\u20ac75 million for Aer Lingus from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. IAG closed a dual-tranche senior unsecured bond issuance in March, raising \\u20ac1.2 billion, with \\u20ac500 million maturing in 2025 and \\u20ac700 million maturing in 2029. In May, IAG raised \\u20ac825 million by issuing a convertible bond, maturing in 2028. During the nine months the Group also signed a committed secured Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) with a syndicate of banks for $1.755 billion, available for three years, plus two consecutive one-year extension periods, at the discretion of the lenders. The facility is available to Aer Lingus, British Airways and Iberia, each of whom has a separate borrower limit within the overall facility. Any drawings under the facility would be secured against eligible unencumbered aircraft assets and take-off and landing rights at both London Heathrow and London Gatwick airports. The facility remained undrawn at the end of September. Simultaneous with entering into this new RCF, British Airways cancelled its US dollar revolving credit facility that was due to expire in June 2021 and which had $786 million undrawn and available at December 31, 2020. Approximately \\u20ac400 million of aircraft financing facilities expired undrawn by the end of March. In July funding of $785 million was secured for British Airways through a sustainability-linked Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) financing, to be drawn down against future aircraft deliveries; at September 30, 2021 $685 million remained undrawn. Total liquidity at the end of the nine months remained strong at \\u20ac10.6 billion, including cash, cash equivalents and current interest-bearing deposits of \\u20ac7.6 billion and committed and undrawn general and aircraft facilities of \\u20ac3.0 billion. On November 1, 2021, the Group closed a \\u00a31 billion committed credit facility for British Airways, partially guaranteed by UK Export Finance, which remains undrawn.\\nThe Group expects that it will take until at least 2023 for passenger demand to reach the levels of 2019. As a result, the Group is actively involved in restructuring its cost base to adjust to significantly lower levels of demand, including actions to reduce fixed costs and to increase the variable proportion of the cost structure.\\nBasis of preparation\\nBased on the extensive modelling the Group has undertaken in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including considering plausible but severe downside scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient liquidity for the going concern assessment period to June 30, 2023 and accordingly the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated results for the nine months to September 30, 2021.\\nHowever, there are a number of significant factors related to the status and impact of COVID-19 worldwide that are outside of the control of the Group. These include the emergence of new variants of the virus and potential resurgence of existing strains of the virus; the availability of vaccines worldwide, together with the speed at which they are deployed; the efficacy of those vaccines; and the restrictions imposed by national governments in respect of the freedom of movement and travel. Due to the uncertainty that these factors create, the Directors are not able to provide certainty that there could not be more severe downside scenarios than those that have been considered in the modelling, including the sensitivities the Group has considered in relation to factors such as the impact on yield, capacity operated, cost mitigations achieved and the availability of aircraft financing to offset capital expenditure. In the event that such a scenario were to occur, the Group would need to implement additional mitigation measures and would likely need to secure additional funding over and above that which is contractually committed at November 4, 2021.\\nThe Group has been successful in raising liquidity in the nine months to September 30, 2021, having financed all aircraft deliveries in the period, secured an additional \\u20ac4.4 billion of non-aircraft debt, secured a new $1.755 billion Revolving Credit Facility, committed for three years and secured a $785 million aircraft-specific facility in the form of a sustainability- linked EETC financing structure. However, the Board cannot provide certainty that the Group will be able to secure additional funding, if required, in the event that a more severe downside scenario than those it has considered were to occur and accordingly this represents a material uncertainty that could cast doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\\nThe Group has continued to maintain its framework and processes to identify, assess and manage risks. The Board continues to meet frequently and review updates, including risk related, from management.\\nThe principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group, detailed on pages 78 to 88 of the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts, remain relevant. The ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (considered as an \\\"Event causing significant network disruption\\\" risk) continue to negatively impact the external risk environment for the Group and change the risk profile of a number of the Group's other principal risks. The Group continues to carefully review its principal risks, implement necessary mitigations to adapt and assess how the severity or likelihood of occurrence of certain risks has changed, which includes consideration of emerging risks related to competitive and market risk, talent and skills retention risk and the acceleration of the digital landscape and customer trends and sentiment to travel. Where further action has been required, the Board has assessed potential mitigations and, where appropriate or feasible, the Group has implemented or confirmed plans that would address those risks.\\nFrom the risks identified in the 2020 Annual Report and Accounts, the main risks that have been impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic and ongoing recovery are highlighted below. Business responses implemented by management and that effectively mitigate or reduce the risk are reflected in the Group's latest business plan and scenarios.\\nAirports, infrastructure and critical third parties. Restrictions at hubs and airports have required capacity adjustments, including fleet adjustments and new operating procedures as markets and regions re-open. The Group has pro-actively worked with suppliers across all categories to ensure that operations are maintained and the impact to their businesses understood, with mitigations implemented where necessary. Additional focus will be placed on key suppliers following the removal of governments' support schemes. Operational bottlenecks such as immigration resource at airports and the potential for Air Traffic Control (ATC) disruption next summer remain outside of the Group's control, although management continues to liaise with the relevant providers to identify potential solutions.   \\nCompetition, consolidation and government regulation. The scale of governmental support and aviation specific state-aid measures and the potential impact to the competitive landscape is under continuous assessment.   \\nData and cyber security. The Group has maintained its planned investment in cyber security. The heightened threat of ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure and services persists and the Group continues to focus its efforts on further mitigating cyber risks through a Group wide cyber programme.   \\nIT systems and IT infrastructure. The Group is reliant upon the resilience of its systems for key customer and business processes and is exposed to risks that relate to poor performance, obsolescence or failure of these systems. The Group is currently engaged in a number of initiatives to modernise its IT systems, whilst also delivering an ongoing efficiency programme and upgrading its digital capability, customer propositions and core IT infrastructure and network where required. Some of these initiatives have been delayed or impacted by actions the Group is taking to respond to the operational and health requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic.   \\nPeople, culture and employee relations. The Group is focussed on staff wellbeing and people morale and motivation, particularly as our people return to their offices and the Group businesses adapt and implement hybrid working models. Welfare support schemes are in place to support the Group's staff and initiatives to build trust and engagement continue across the Group's businesses. The Group has identified the skills and capabilities that are required to manage its transformation, which include enhancing its leadership capability and delivering on the Group's diversity and inclusion plans. Employee consultations linked to restructuring proposals have been undertaken as required.   \\nPolitical and economic environment. National governments continue to impose varying and complex travel and testing requirements, which will continue to impact Group operations and dampen demand as customers choose not to fly given the uncertainty around the application and cost of these. These changes are being actively monitored and near-term capacity plans are refreshed dynamically, according to the latest status. The economic impact of the pandemic, especially with the focus on potential future variants driving further uncertainty, is expected to be significant and the Group will continue to adjust its future capacity plans accordingly, retaining flexibility to adapt as required.   \\nDebt funding and financial risk. Financial markets have been volatile since the spread of the pandemic, although the Group has been able to secure new funding and facilities as needed. The Group has an established process to monitor financial and counterparty risk on an ongoing basis. The Group implemented a new fuel hedging policy during May 2021, providing greater flexibility over fuel hedging.   \\nThe Board and its sub committees have been appraised of regulatory, competitor and governmental responses on an ongoing basis.\\nOperating and market environment\\nAverage commodity fuel prices for the nine months to September 30, 2021 were approximately 40 per cent higher than the equivalent period in 2020, with prices rising since the start of 2021, in contrast to the significant fall in March 2020 as COVID-19 took hold. The US dollar weakened approximately eight per cent against the euro and nine per cent against the pound sterling compared with 2020.\\nIAG's results are impacted by exchange rates used for the translation of British Airways' and IAG Loyalty's financial results from pound sterling to the Group's reporting currency of euro. For the nine months to September 30, 2021 the net impact of translation on the operating result before exceptional items was \\u20ac15 million adverse.\\nFrom a transactional perspective, the Group's financial performance is impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates, primarily from the US dollar, euro and pound sterling. The Group normally generates a surplus in most currencies in which it does business, except for the US dollar, as capital expenditure, debt repayments and fuel purchases typically create a deficit. The Group hedges a portion of its transaction exposures. The net transaction impact on the operating result before exceptional items was favourable by \\u20ac188 million for the period, reducing revenues by \\u20ac114 million and reducing costs by \\u20ac302 million.\\nThe net impact of translation and transaction exchange on the operating result before exceptional items for the nine months was \\u20ac173 million favourable.\\nCapacity\\nIn the nine months to September 30, 2021, IAG capacity, measured in available seat kilometres (ASKs), was lower by 18.9 per cent versus 2020 and by 71.0 per cent versus 2019, with the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic felt across all regions. Q3 2021 saw the highest passenger numbers and load factors since the start of the pandemic, however capacity continues to be affected by the travel restrictions put in place by national governments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and variants of the virus.\\nDuring quarter 1, British Airways capacity was adversely impacted by the UK-wide lockdown imposed at the beginning of January and associated international travel ban. Longhaul routes operated primarily for cargo purposes with daily flights to several US cities. Shorthaul operations were severely limited by restrictions, but regular operations connected the main cities and saw steady business travel demand. Iberia's longhaul operations were focussed on Latin America and the Caribbean (LACAR) and benefitted from Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR) travel over the Christmas and New year period and in the lead up to Easter, although the EU restrictions introduced in response to the identification of the Brazil COVID-19 variant adversely impacted passenger numbers. Vueling operations were focussed on Domestic markets, connecting the Spanish peninsula with the Canary and Balearic Islands. Aer Lingus capacity continued to be driven by cargo needs, with flights operating regularly to New York, JFK, Chicago and Boston with very low passenger load factors. LEVEL longhaul operations out of Barcelona were very limited with only regular flights to Buenos Aires in quarter 1.\\nDuring quarter 2, British Airways capacity was impacted by the UK government's travel restrictions and the re-introduction of the traffic light travel system. The restricted nature of the 'green' list severely limited the recovery in capacity expected on the lifting of lockdown restrictions. Restrictions introduced by other governments on travellers from the UK in response to the delta COVID-19 variant also contributed to the low capacity. Iberia longhaul operations continued to focus on LACAR with routes to Colombia and Ecuador benefitting from VFR traffic. Shorthaul routes benefitted from high levels of transfer traffic in the quarter. Vueling operations in the quarter benefitted from the Spanish government lifting the state of alarm on May 9, 2021 and the associated restrictions on travel. Domestic routes connecting the Spanish peninsula with the Canary and Balearic Islands performed well. Aer Lingus capacity continued to be severely limited by the stringent restrictions put in place by the Irish government, with passenger load factors averaging only 20 per cent. Operations were driven by cargo needs, with flights operating regularly to New York, Chicago and Boston. LEVEL continued regular operations to Buenos Aires and towards the end of the quarter restarted flights to San Francisco.\\nDuring quarter 3, British Airways capacity was impacted by the UK traffic light travel system and the stringent testing requirements for travel. Longhaul routes to North America and Asia Pacific continued to be driven by cargo requirements with low passenger load factors. Leisure routes performed well in the quarter with high load factors on Caribbean routes as well as European destinations on the green and amber lists. Iberia longhaul operations continued to focus on LACAR with routes continuing to benefit from VFR traffic. Restrictions put in place by the Argentinian government limited operations, but this was offset by easing of restrictions in Brazil and Chile. Shorthaul routes benefitted from summer leisure traffic across the network. Vueling's capacity increased in the quarter and Domestic and European routes benefited from summer vacation travel. Domestic capacity recovered to above 2019 levels as routes connecting the peninsula to the Canary and Balearic Islands performed well. Aer Lingus expanded operations in quarter 3 following the Irish government's decision to ease travel restrictions for non-essential travel on July 19, 2021. Domestic capacity also increased following the transfer of a number of routes from Stobart Air following its liquidation. LEVEL restarted routes to New York and Mexico in the quarter, however overall capacity was impacted by strict restrictions put in place by the Argentinian government on routes operating to Buenos Aires.\\nUnit measures have been rendered much less meaningful than usual by the significant reduction in capacity operated but are included in the commentary below for completeness.\\nRevenue\\nPassenger revenue for the nine months to September 30, 2021 fell 35.0 per cent from the previous year; in 2020 the impact of COVID-19 was mainly limited to the period from March onwards. Passenger unit revenue (passenger revenue per ASK) for the nine months decreased 20.6 per cent at constant currency ('ccy'), due primarily to lower passenger seat factors, together with lower passenger yields (passenger revenue per revenue passenger kilometre), associated with the impact of COVID-19.\\nCargo revenue for the nine months was 28.0 per cent higher versus 2020 and up 31.7 per cent at constant currency. The strong cargo revenue performance was due to additional cargo-driven flights; during the nine months 3,334 cargo-only flights were operated. Cargo revenue for the nine months was \\u20ac1,174 million, up from \\u20ac917 million in the previous year and total cargo carried, measured in cargo tonne kilometres (CTKs) was 15.0 per cent higher. Yields were higher versus last year reflecting the ongoing market supply and demand imbalance. During this pandemic, cargo revenue has had to cover the entire cost of operating cargo-only flights, without passenger revenue, on aircraft configured for passengers.\\nOther revenue fell by 20.1 per cent and by 15.7 per cent at ccy, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 on the Group's non- airline businesses.\\nCosts\\nEmployee costs for the nine months decreased by \\u20ac519 million compared with 2020, mainly linked to the restructuring programmes implemented in 2020. The Group continued to receive assistance from temporary furlough and equivalent temporary cost reduction schemes, which in the nine months amounted to \\u20ac481 million, compared with \\u20ac414 million in the same period in 2020.\\nFuel costs, including an exceptional credit related to overhedging of \\u20ac153 million in 2021 and an exceptional charge of\\n\\u20ac1,599 million related to overhedging in 2020, reduced by 68.0 per cent. Excluding the exceptional overhedging credit in the period and the overhedging charge in 2020, fuel costs reduced by 28.6 per cent.\\nSupplier costs decreased by 27.7 per cent, linked to volume-related savings due to the lower capacity operated, together with a reduction in non-essential expenditure and negotiated savings as a result of COVID-19.\\nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment costs, including an exceptional impairment credit of \\u20ac13 million in 2021 and an exceptional impairment charge in 2020 of \\u20ac716 million, decreased by 40.7 per cent on the previous year, linked to the reduction in the Group's fleet triggered by COVID-19 and the related impairment charge. Excluding the exceptional impairment credit in 2021 and exceptional impairment charge in 2020, Depreciation, amortisation and impairment costs decreased by 13.7 per cent. The in-service fleet, which includes those aircraft temporarily grounded due to COVID-19, reduced from 542 aircraft at September 2020 to 533 aircraft at September 2021.\\nTotal non-fuel costs were down 30.9 per cent on the previous year and down 29.5 per cent at ccy. Excluding the impact of exceptional charges in 2020, mainly relating to fleet and related asset impairments, and exceptional credits related to the reversal of impairments in respect of four aircraft in 2021, non-fuel costs were down 21.3 per cent and down 19.7 per cent at ccy.\\nOperating loss\\nThe Group's reported operating loss for the nine months to September 30, 2021 was \\u20ac2,487 million (2020 restated: operating loss of \\u20ac5,975 million). The operating loss excluding exceptional credits in 2021 and exceptional charges in 2020, which are outlined in the Reconciliation of Alternative Performance Measures, was \\u20ac2,665 million for the nine months to September 30, 2021, compared with a restated operating loss of \\u20ac3,220 million in 2020. In 2020 the impact of COVID-19 was experienced mainly from March onwards; by contrast all nine months of 2021 were significantly negatively affected by COVID-19 and the related travel restrictions.\\nNet non-operating costs, taxation and loss after tax\\nThe tax credit on the result after exceptional items for the nine months to September 30, 2021 was \\u20ac428 million (2020:\\n\\u20ac638 million), and the effective tax rate was 14 per cent (2020: 10 per cent). The substantial majority of the Group's activities are taxed where the main operations are based, UK, Spain and Ireland, with corporation tax rates during 2021 of 19 per cent, 25 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively, these result in an expected effective tax rate of 20 per cent. The difference between the actual effective tax rate of 14 per cent and the expected effective tax rate of 20 per cent is primarily due to certain current and prior period losses in Iberia and Vueling not being recognised and the effect of the rate change in the UK.\\nOn March 3, 2021 the UK Chancellor announced that legislation would be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to set the main rate of corporation tax at 25 per cent from April 2023. On May 24, 2021 the increase in the rate of corporation tax in the UK was substantially enacted, which has led to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances at September 30, 2021 and will increase the Group's future current tax charge accordingly.\\nOn October 8, 2021 the Irish government announced that it would increase the rate of corporation tax for certain multinational businesses to 15 per cent with effect from 2023. This expected tax rate change has not been reflected in these results because it has not yet been substantively enacted.\\nThe loss after tax and exceptional items for the nine months was \\u20ac2,622 million (2020 restated: loss after tax \\u20ac5,576 million), driven by the impact of COVID-19 on the Group's operating results.\\nCash and leverage\\nThe Group's cash position (including cash, cash equivalents and current interest-bearing deposits) at September 30, 2021 of \\u20ac7,619 million was \\u20ac1,702 million higher than December 31, 2020, driven by the additional liquidity actions taken in the nine months. Net debt at the end of the period was \\u20ac12,356 million compared with \\u20ac9,762 million at December 31, 2020.\\nOther recent developments\\nOn October 27, 2021 Iberia submitted remedies to the European Commission as part of the Commission's ongoing review of the proposed acquisition of Air Europa by Iberia.\\nOn November 1, 2021, the Group closed a \\u00a31.0 billion committed, five-year, credit facility for British Airways. The facility is provided by a syndicate of relationship banks and is partially guaranteed by UK Export Finance. The facility is unsecured and remains undrawn.\\nFor the full financial report, see:   https://www.iairgroup.com/~/media/Files/I/IAG/documents/iag-q3-2021-financial-results-en.pdf\\nJapan Airlines (TSE:9201)\\nEstablished\\nThe predecessor of our current company, Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. was founded on August 1, 1951 with 100 million yen in capital and began scheduled air transportation on domestic routes independently from October of the following year.\\nBased on the Japan Airlines Act (Act No. 154 of 1953), as of October 1, 1953, the current company was established with 1 billion yen in government funding and 1 billion yen in sales, for a total of 2 billion yen in capital.\\nIn this way, the established company inherited all of the rights and obligations of the previous company and became licensed to become the nation's only scheduled international air carrier, along with its domestic routes.\\n1 August 2022\\nJAL Group Announces Consolidated Financial Results for First Quarter Ending March 31, 2023\\nThe JAL Group today announced the consolidated financial results for First Quarter Ending March,\\nPeriod April 1, 2022-June 30,2022.\\n1\\uff0e JAL Group Consolidated results\\nPassenger demand that had decreased significantly by the COVID infection was on a recovery trend again in this first quarter due to the advancement of vaccination and adjustment to a post-COVID lifestyle. International passenger demand has been gradually recovering as worldwide border restrictions eased and business travels from Japan restarted. Domestic passenger demand has been steadily recovering especially from the Tokyo metropolitan area as the state of emergency declaration and similar preventive measures were fully lifted. For cargo business, despite the Russia-Ukraine situation, disrupted ocean shipments led to strong demand for air cargo and further price increase, which resulted in our cargo business to remain very strong. During this period, fuel prices rose and the yen depreciated significantly.\\nIn the above business environment, the revenue for the first quarter were increased by 102.1% year on year to 268.8 billion yen, the operating expenses increased by 40.7% year on year to 303.0 billion yen, the loss/earning before financing and income tax (hereinafter referred as \\\"EBIT\\\") was loss of 27.5 billion yen (EBIT loss of 82.6 billion yen in the previous year). The loss attributable to owners of the parent was 19.5 billion yen (the loss attributable to owners of the parent 57.9 billion yen in the previous year). Fuel expenses for the period totaled 69.8 billion yen, increased by 162.6% from the same period last year, and actual fixed costs amounted to 120.7 billion yen.\\nInternational passenger revenue for Full-Service Carriers was 62.4billion yen (increased by 457.0% year on year), domestic passenger revenue was 88.0 billion yen (increased by 131.4% year on year), and cargo mail revenue was 65.3 billion yen (increased by 37.1% year on year).\\nDetails of the consolidated financial results are as follows (Including LCC)\\n2\\uff0e Summary of Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Cash Flow\\nEquity ratio is 39.2% for credit evaluation basis, Net D/E ratio is x0.2, keeping a healthy level.   \\nLiquidity at hand was maintained at a sufficient amount of 530.3 billion yen at the end of June, as   \\nwell as the unused credit line of 250.0 billion yen, which has been reduced because of the improvement of cash inflow.   \\nAs a result of a recovery trend in passenger demand, Operating cash flow is 78.7 billion yen of inflow and Free cash flow is 46.3 billion yen of inflow.   \\n3\\uff0e  First Quarter and recent initiatives\\n\\u3010ESG strategy\\u3011\\n- In June, our ESG initiatives and its disclosure were highly evaluated and thus JAL was selected as a constituent of two leading investment indices, \\\"the FTSE Blossom Japan Index\\\" and \\\"the FTSE Blossom Japan Sector Relative Index\\\".\\n\\u3010Full-Service Carrier business domain\\u3011\\n-On international routes, due to the easing of entry restrictions to Japan and other\\nfactors, gradual recovery of passenger demand to/from Japan. In addition, JAL steadily captured transit passenger demand travelling between Asia and North America.\\n-For domestic routes, we conducted promotional campaigns with local governments and railroad companies to stimulate Tokyo-inbound demand. Also, JAL has almost completed upgrading the main large-size fleets to A350s which enabled us to provide enough capacity to meet the recovering demand in a timely manner. Due to this, JAL were able to effectively\\ncapture the strong demand during the long-holiday season in May.\\n\\u3010LCC business domain\\u3011\\n- Our mid- and long-haul international low-cost carrier, ZIPAIR Tokyo (ZIPAIR), has been gradually recognized by leisure customers and some flights were fully booked during the peak season. Spring Japan that had become our subsidiary since June 2021, Jetstar Japan started to fly cutting-edge, fuel-efficient A321LR aircraft from July, the three low-cost carriers will continue to provide their customers with useful services and expand their business.\\n\\u3010Non-aviation business domain\\u3011\\n- JAL launched a new partnership program with one of the largest point service providers in Japan, Rakuten Point, which provided the JAL Groups'customers with much more occasions to earn and redeem JAL mileage.\\n- For JALUX that became our subsidiary last fiscal year, JAL and JALUX mutually used their respective know-how and resources to conduct joint sales of flight simulator experience as\\nwell as the development of new products.\\n4\\uff0eFuture Outlook\\nThere is no change to our current full-year forecast of this fiscal year ending March 2023 that was disclosed on May 6, 2022. As the society shifts toward a balance of social economic activities and COVID prevention, both international and domestic passenger demand have been steadily recovering. There still exists various uncertain external environments including the Russia-Ukraine situation or price hike of raw materials including fuel. However, we will strive all together to achieve our performance target of 80 billion yen in EBIT.\\n5. Dividends\\nAlthough our performance and cash flow have been steadily improving, our first quarter EBIT results was a loss of 27.5 billion yen. Thus, there is need to carefully monitor further performance. Therefore, we regret that we cannot pay the interim dividends to shareholders, but we would like to ask for their understanding in this situation. For the year-end dividends for the fiscal year ending March 2023, while we must keep a close eye on the geopolitical risk or the fuel price hike risk, we will aim for achieving our profit target and dividends payment for the fiscal year ending March 2023, unless there occur significant negative events. We will update our forecast immediately when our performance becomes foreseeable.\\nhttps://press.jal.co.jp/en/release/202208/006838.html\\nKLM (EPA:AF)\\nKLM's Company Profile\\nKLM was established on 7 October 1919, making it the world's oldest airline still operating under its original name.

Through their majority control of Hanjin KAL Corporation, the Cho family, the owner family of Hanjin Group is still the airline's largest and controlling, shareholder; Cho Won-tae (aka Walter Cho), its current Chairman and CEO, is the third generation of the family to lead the airline.\\nAbout Us\\nOn March 1, 1969, Korean Air started off as a small airline in Asia, with only eight planes. Since then, we have striven to develop new markets and improve customer service through continuous changes and investments.\\n\\\"To be a respected leader in the world airline community.\\\" This is the vision we announced in 2004 to celebrate Korean Air's 35th anniversary. Under the slogan, \\\"Excellence in Flight,\\\" we have been endeavouring to provide our customers with safer and more distinguished services than any other airline in the world.\\nIn 2019, Korean Air celebrated its 50th anniversary. With the love of our customers and trust of our nation, Korean Air has soared to greater heights as a leading global airline. We will never forget that our roots lie in the support and trust shown by our customers, who have been calling us the \\\"Wings of the People\\\" over the past half a century.\\nKorean Air is taking the next step and flying towards another 100 years. We will be reborn as the \\\"Wings of the World\\\" and contribute to creating a better society for all.\\nUnder the core values of \\\"safety\\\" and \\\"customer satisfaction,\\\" we will continue dedicating the utmost effort to establishing Korean Air, an airline everyone wants to fly with, as a respected leader in the global aviation industry.\\nhttps://www.koreanair.com/my/en/footer/about-us/who-we-are/overview/greetings\\n4 May 2022\\nKorean Air's tentative financial results for Q1 2022 (Non-consolidated)\\nKorean Air posted a revenue of KRW 2.8052 trillion (USD 2.3168 billion) and a record quarterly operating profit of KRW 788.4 billion (USD 651.1 million) in its first quarter financial results.   \\n\\u203b Previous quarterly operating profit record: Q4 2021, KRW 704.4 billion\\nRevenue from the airline's passenger flight operations in the first quarter increased by 128% year-on-year to KRW 359.8 billion. Although passenger demand remained sluggish due to the spread of the COVID-19 Omicron variant, demand is gradually recovering as countries ease their entry restrictions one by one. On March 21, Korea lifted the mandatory quarantine for fully vaccinated travelers, helping to boost travel demand.   \\nThe airline's cargo flight operations pulled in a revenue of KRW 2.1486 trillion in the first quarter. Uncertainties in the air cargo market persisted due to various external factors such as global supply chain bottlenecks, reduction in capacity on Europe routes and high fuel prices. Korean Air is taking preemptive measures to maintain its air cargo capacity through close management of ground handling operations and flexible network operations. The airline maximized its revenue through increasing freighter operation rates and using grounded passenger jets on cargo routes.   \\nKorean Air's passenger business is expected to quickly recover in 2022, as more countries continue to open up their borders and ease entry restrictions. The recovery of passenger demand will vary by route and region, and the airline will closely monitor and flexibly respond to the market and changing quarantine policies of its network.   \\nRecovery in global passenger demand is foreseen to gradually boost global air cargo capacity, but instability in regional air cargo markets is expected to persist due to major Chinese city lockdowns and the war in Ukraine. Korean Air will tackle such uncertainties by actively responding to market changes through flexible operations and effective management of ground handling operations.   \\nWhile the entire industry was suffering from COVID-19, Korean Air significantly improved its financial structure by reducing debt. At the end of 2019, the airline's debt ratio was 814 percent, but as of the first quarter of 2022, the number decreased by 559 percentage points to 255 percent, the lowest debt ratio since 2011, when International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) were introduced. Moreover, Korean Air has secured over KRW 4 trillion worth of cash and cashable assets, enabling the airline to flexibly respond to various market uncertainties, such as increasing interest rates. Korean Air plans to maintain financial stability through profitable operations and by managing its debt ratio and liquidity.   \\nhttps://www.koreanair.com/my/en/footer/about-us/newsroom/list/220503-financial-results\\nLufthansa (DAX: LHA)\\nBusiness Activities\\nThe Lufthansa Group is an aviation group with operations worldwide. With 135,353 employees, the Lufthansa Group generated revenue of EUR 36,424m in the financial year 2019. The Lufthansa Group is composed of the segments Network Airlines, Eurowings and Aviation Services. Aviation Services comprises the segments Logistics, MRO, Catering and Additional Businesses and Group Functions. The latter also include Lufthansa AirPlus, Lufthansa Aviation Training, and the IT companies. All segments occupy a leading position in their respective markets.\\nOrganisation\\nDeutsche Lufthansa AG has the management and supervisory structures typical for companies in Germany. The Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company and defining its strategic direction. In doing so, the aim is to increase Company value sustainably. The Supervisory Board appoints, advises, and supervises the Executive Board. Deutsche Lufthansa AG is the parent company and the largest single operating company in the Lufthansa Group. The individual business segments are run as separate Group companies, with the exception of the Lufthansa Passenger Airlines. They have their own profit and operating responsibility and are monitored by their respective supervisory boards, in which members of Deutsche Lufthansa AG's Executive Board are also represented.\\nhttps://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/company/company-portrait.html\\n5 May 2022\\nLufthansa Group benefits from significant increase in demand during the first quarter of 2022 and expects record summer for holiday travel.\\nDemand increases significantly in the first quarter   \\nLufthansa Cargo again with a record result   \\nSignificantly positive Adjusted free cash flow driven by strong bookings   \\nFinancial outlook confirmed despite uncertain fuel cost outlook   \\nGroup plans to terminate stabilization measures in Switzerland in the second quarter   \\nCarsten Spohr, CEO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, said:\\n\\\"The world is currently witnessing the importance of understanding and collaboration among people. Aviation makes an important contribution to this - it strengthens the exchange between people. We continue on our mission to connect people, cultures and economies in a sustainable way.\\nThe restrictions on air traffic have largely been overcome. We are now mentally ticking off the crisis and once again leading the way - more focused, more efficient and more sustainable than before the pandemic. The past few weeks in particular have clearly shown how great people's desire to travel is. New bookings are increasing from week to week - among business travelers, but especially for vacation and leisure travel.\\nSupply chains around the world are still disrupted while demand for freight capacity remains high. This makes our strategic decision to further strengthen Lufthansa Cargo even more valuable.\\\"\\nFirst Quarter Results 2022\\nThe Lufthansa Group recovered from the spread of the Omicron variant over the course of the first quarter of 2022. After the beginning of the year was still burdened by high infection rates especially in the Group's home markets, customer demand started to recover strongly, especially in March. In addition to high touristic demand, the business travel segment also recorded an increasing recovery.\\nCompared to the previous year, the Group more than doubled its revenue to 5.4 billion euros (previous year: 2.6 billion euros). Adjusted EBIT amounted to\\n591 million euros and thereby also improved noticeably compared to the prior year quarter, despite the effects of the pandemic (previous year:   \\n1.0 billion euros). The Adjusted EBIT margin increased accordingly to   \\n11.0 percent (previous year: -40.9 percent). Net income of -584 million euros also improved compared to the same quarter in the prior year (previous year: -1.0 billion euros).   \\nGroup airlines quadruple passenger numbers\\nThe number of passengers on board the Group airlines more than quadrupled in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Between January and March, the airlines of the Lufthansa Group welcomed 13 million passengers on board (previous year: 3 million).\\nAs a result of the strong increase in demand for air travel during the first quarter, the available capacity was also significantly increased towards the end of the quarter. Between January and March 2022, passenger airline capacity averaged 57 percent of the pre-crisis level (171 percent up on the previous year).\\nThe Adjusted EBIT of the passenger airlines amounted to -1.1 billion euros (previous year: -1.4 billion euros). The result was burdened by low seat load factors especially at the beginning of the quarter, rising fuel costs and the non-recurrence of short-time work subsidies in the prior year. However, yields were close to pre-crisis levels. On long-haul, yields even exceeded the 2019 level.\\nLufthansa Cargo strength continues, Lufthansa Technik achieves clearly positive result\\nThe positive earnings development in the logistics business segment continued in the first quarter of 2022. Cargo capacities worldwide continue to be limited by the lack of belly capacity in passenger aircraft and disruption in global supply chains, while demand remains high. This benefited Lufthansa Cargo which again achieved a record result. Adjusted EBIT rose by 57 percent in the first quarter to 495 million euros (previous year: 315 million euros).\\nThe business of Lufthansa Technik continued to recover in the first quarter of 2022. Demand for maintenance and repair services increased as airlines worldwide prepare for further market recovery in the coming months. Lufthansa Technik achieved a positive Adjusted EBIT of 120 million euros in the first quarter of 2022 (previous year: 45 million euros). The business unit thus improved its earnings by 167 percent.\\nThe LSG Group's result was down on the previous year with an Adjusted EBIT of -14 million euros (previous year: -8 million euros) due to the absence of government support measures in the USA. Without this effect, the result would have improved.\\nStrong free cash flow, liquidity continues to increase\\nIn the course of the first quarter of 2022, the number of bookings increased sharply - especially towards the end of the quarter. Many people booked their long-awaited Easter and summer holidays during this time. Driven by the high level of incoming bookings, adjusted free cash flow was clearly positive at 780 million euros (previous year: -953 million euros). As a consequence, net debt declined to 8.3 billion euros at March 31, 2022 (Dec 31, 2021: 9.0 billion\\neuros).\\nAt the end of March 2022, the company's available liquidity amounted to 9.9 billion euros. Thereby, liquidity continues to exceed the target range of 6 to 8 billion euros. This does not yet include the signing of a revolving credit facility at the beginning of April, which increases the volume of available credit lines by 1.3 billion euros. At the end of December 2021, the available liquidity of the Lufthansa Group amounted to 9.4 billion euros.\\nDue to the positive liquidity development, the company intends to terminate the stabilization measures in Switzerland ahead of schedule in the second quarter. At the end of the first quarter, SWISS had drawn down 210 million Swiss francs of the state-backed loan facility amounting to 1.5 billion Swiss francs in total. After the repayment of the drawn portion, the entire credit line shall be terminated in full.\\nRemco Steenbergen, CFO of Deutsche Lufthansa AG:\\n\\\"Demand has recovered faster and stronger than expected in recent weeks. The current level of bookings gives us confidence that our financial results will further improve in the coming quarters.\\nWe must pass through rising costs to customers. In addition, the implementation of the remaining cost reduction measures amounting to a good half billion euros will contribute to making our company as resilient as possible in the current uncertain environment.\\\"\\nOutlook\\nThe desire for people to travel is great. In recent weeks, more flight tickets were bought than at any time since the beginning of the pandemic. Last week (CW17), the company sold more flight tickets in one week as in the same period in 2019. With over 120 classic holiday destinations, the airlines of the Lufthansa Group are offering more choice of tourist destinations than ever before. Destinations in the USA, South America and the Mediterranean are in particularly high demand. This summer, more people are expected to fly on holiday with the airlines of the Lufthansa Group than ever before. The volume of business travel in the Group is also expected to recover by the end of the year to around 70 percent of its pre-crisis level. Due to continued high demand in the premium segment and rising price levels, the Lufthansa Group expects an at least high-single-digit percentage rate increase of average yields in the remainder of 2022 compared to 2021. As result, yields will exceed the pre-crisis level of 2019.\\nThe company plans to offer around 75 percent of the pre-crisis capacity in the second quarter of 2022. This should significantly improve the passenger airlines' result. In the Logistics and MRO segments the positive trends of the past three months should continue.\\nFor the full year 2022, the Lufthansa Group is planning an annual average passenger airline capacity of around 75 percent. In the summer, around 95 percent of the pre-crisis capacity will be offered on European short-haul routes and around 85 percent on the Transatlantic.\\nNevertheless, uncertainties remain for the company's further business development. In view of the extreme changes in the price of kerosene in recent weeks, the development of fuel costs in particular cannot be accurately forecasted for the year as a whole. Equally, the effects of the war in Ukraine and the significant increase in inflation on consumer behavior cannot be predicted precisely. The financial forecast for the full year remains unchanged for an improvement in Adjusted EBIT compared to the previous year.\\nhttps://investor-relations.lufthansagroup.com/en/news/financial-news/investor-relations-financial-news/date/2022/05/05/lufthansa-group-benefits-from-significant-increase-in-demand-during-the-first-quarter-of-2022-and-expects-record-summer-for-holiday-travel.html\\nQantas Group (ASX: QAN)\\nAbout Qantas Group\\nQantas is the world's second oldest airline.

Qantas Loyalty provides a stable, cash growth vehicle for the Group's earnings profile.   \\nhttps://investor.qantas.com/home/?page=about-the-qantas-group\\n24 February 2022\\nQANTAS GROUP POSTS HALF YEAR LOSS BUT STRENGTHENS BALANCE SHEET\\nUnderlying EBITDA loss: $(245) million.   \\nUnderlying Loss Before Tax: $(1.28) billion.   \\nStatutory Loss Before Tax: $(622) million.   \\nPositive statutory net free cash flow: $552 million, supported by Mascot land sale and strong Qantas Loyalty and Freight cash contribution.   \\nNet debt declined to $5.5 billion; within target range.   \\nTotal liquidity of $4.3 billion.   \\nFlying performance significantly impacted by lockdowns, ramp-up costs.   \\nApproximately $(650) million negative impacts from Omicron in 2H22.   \\nRecovery program on track to deliver >$900 million in annualised cost benefits by end FY22 (ahead of schedule).   \\nRecovery and retention plan for employees, including 1,000 share rights for approximately 20,000 employees.   \\nThe impact of Delta lockdowns and emergence of the Omicron strain drove the Qantas Group to its fourth consecutive half yearly statutory loss of the pandemic, but with some tailwinds accelerating balance sheet repair.\\nThe Group's flying operations were severely impacted by widespread domestic lockdowns and continued international restrictions, reducing the Group's total flying to 18 per cent of pre-COVID levels during the half.\\nAs a result of these severely depressed market conditions and ramp-up costs, the Group recorded an Underlying EBITDA loss of $245 million for the first half of FY22. Underlying EBIT loss was $1.13 billion, reflecting non-cash depreciation and amortisation. Revenue losses since the start of the pandemic grew to more than $22 billion.\\nHowever, cash generated from the sale of under-utilised land at Mascot; a rush of flight bookings as the Delta lockdowns ended; international border closures easing in the second quarter; and strong contributions from Qantas Freight and Qantas Loyalty made significant inroads to balance sheet repair. Net debt finished the half at $5.5 billion, putting it within the Group's target range.\\nIn a sign of the post-Delta recovery, the Group recorded three consecutive months of positive net free cash flow between October and December (excluding the land sale), largely as a result of the recovery in forward bookings.\\nThe quick ramp-up of key international services, plus the addition of new routes across Jetstar and Qantas, was key to seizing early momentum in travel demand as restrictions eased.\\nLiquidity remained strong with $4.3 billion in cash and undrawn facilities as at 31 December.\\nConcern regarding the Omicron strain had a dampening impact on travel demand in December that intensified in January and was compounded by the unexpected delay to Western Australia's border opening. However, forward demand for both international and domestic services has improved during February - helped by Australia's full reopening to all visa holders and the announcement of a new date for WA's borders to open. This positive momentum is expected to continue in coming months.\\nThe slow recovery in travel demand exacerbated stranded labour costs associated with the decision to stand up all Australian-based employees in December. This resulted in a temporary surplus of around 17 per cent of the Group's workforce in quarter three.\\nGROUP DOMESTIC\\nDelta-related lockdowns meant that domestic travel demand was heavily subdued for most of the first half, with the Group only flying 42 per cent of its pre-COVID capacity. While there was a positive demand spike in November and December, the traditional summer peak was below expectations due to Omicron- related uncertainty.\\nGroup Domestic operations recorded an Underlying EBITDA loss of $388 million.\\nWith the 15 new routes launched in the six months to December 31, Qantas and Jetstar have now announced 48 new domestic routes in the past 18 months as Australians look for new opportunities to travel.\\nCareful management of capacity meant that 92 per cent of the Group's domestic flying in the half was cash positive.\\nAlmost half of the $840 million in structural recovery benefits delivered so far have been in Qantas Domestic, with a final target of approximately $500 million per annum in savings by the end of FY23 - resulting in a significantly lower cost base compared with pre-COVID that will assist with recovery in a competitive market.\\nWithin the period, the Group announced the Airbus A320neo and A220 families as the preferred aircraft for Project Winton, its domestic fleet renewal program. The decision is still subject to final Board approval and discussions with work groups on the arrangements required to operate the aircraft, with an order anticipated by the end of FY22.\\nGROUP INTERNATIONAL AND FREIGHT\\nA record performance by Freight offset cash losses from Qantas International as it emerged from hibernation, with the whole division achieving positive Underlying EBITDA of $89 million. Depreciation and amortisation took this to an Underlying EBIT loss of $238 million.\\nThe standout result by Qantas Freight highlights the natural hedge it has provided during the pandemic due to a lack of cargo capacity on passenger aircraft.\\nWhile some of this demand will ease beyond FY22 as international passenger flights increase, there has been a permanent shift in e-commerce patterns and freight operations are expected to remain higher than pre-COVID levels. In response, Qantas announced the conversion of two A330 passenger aircraft into freighters to support this market shift as well as taking delivery of its third A321 freighter.\\nQantas was able to ramp-up quickly to take advantage of accelerated international border openings in November, with high levels of pent-up demand captured on new services to Delhi and the return of services to London, Los Angeles and Singapore.\\nDespite these bright spots, international flying remained significantly impacted by the continued closure of Australia's international border to tourists throughout the half, and the reintroduction of border restrictions by other countries as they managed Omicron.\\nQantas International has achieved approximately $325 million in recurring structural cost benefits and is on track to increase this to greater than $400 million by FY23, which will significantly assist in recovery.\\nJetstar had limited opportunities to fly internationally due to continued border restrictions across its key markets in South East Asia. Jetstar Japan narrowed its losses as domestic flying in that market started to recover.\\nQANTAS LOYALTY\\nQantas Loyalty remains a strong performer with continued earnings growth in the first half of FY22 delivering a strong cash contribution and an Underlying EBIT of $127 million.\\nThe number of Frequent Flyer members continued to grow (up 150,000 to 13.8 million) as did the number of points earned on the ground. All five major financial services partners have been re-signed as well as key supermarket partner, Woolworths. New and expanded deals were signed with Optus, Accor and bp, creating more opportunities for members to earn and redeem points.\\nIn a continued expansion into financial services, Qantas Business Money will launch in 4Q22, enabling small to medium enterprises to transact in foreign currencies at highly competitive rates and earn points in the process, in a partnership with Airwallex.\\nA combination of border openings and increase in seats available to Frequent Flyer members by up to 50 per cent saw some record levels of redemption. The program also maintained record levels of member satisfaction in the half.\\nQantas Loyalty announced a new Green Frequent Flyer tier, aimed at rewarding members for making eco- friendly decisions on the ground as well as in the air.\\nSUSTAINABILITY UPDATE\\nSustainability is a key priority for the Group as it emerges from the pandemic. Significant work took place in the half on the pathway to reach net zero emissions by 2050. In a first for any Australian airline, Qantas purchased up to 30 million litres of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) over three years for flights departing Heathrow, London.\\nIn March, the Group will announce more detail on its sustainability strategy, including an emissions reduction target for 2030.\\nLOOKING AFTER CUSTOMERS\\nUncertainty around border restrictions and testing requirements has been a significant challenge for customers as travel resumes. Recent initiatives to help include:\\nFly Well - continued investment in technology to increase contactless and self-service options at airports; social distancing as lounges have re-opened; enhanced cleaning onboard.   \\nCOVID help hub - guiding customers through every step of their journey from destination-specific information at the time of booking, to reminders and tailored messages as they get ready to fly.   \\nFly Flexible - unlimited date changes on all Qantas domestic and international fares extended through to April 2022.   \\nExtension of flight vouchers - extended credit vouchers to enable travel until 31 December 2023, with Jetstar doing the same for vouchers issued due to COVID-19 disruptions.   \\nCOVID insurance - offering peace of mind with COVID-specific travel insurance.   \\nVaccine recognition program - over 700,000 customers received Qantas Points, status credits and flight vouchers in recognition of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19   \\nREWARDING EMPLOYEES\\nAs the Qantas Group recovers from the pandemic, it's important that employees who help deliver that recovery share in the success.\\nOur people have faced unprecedented challenge and uncertainty over the past two years, enduring long periods of stand downs as well as wage freezes as the Group battled to remain viable and moved to repair the damage done by COVID.\\nThe Board today confirmed that a Recovery and Retention Plan - which was first flagged in September 2021 - will reward around 20,000 eligible non-executive employees with rights to 1,000 Qantas shares.\\nAt the current share price, the rights for each eligible employee are valued at more than $5,000. As the Group recovers, these rights allow us to reward our employees in line with shareholders.\\nThe rights are subject to conditions including the Group delivering on the key targets of its COVID recovery plan and the employee remaining with the company. If conditions are met, the rights will convert to shares in August 2023. These will be new shares issued by Qantas to employees.\\nNo annual executive bonuses will be paid in FY22 for the third year in a row and in addition to a two year wage freeze. However, managers and senior executives will be eligible for a share rights-based Recovery and Retention bonus in August 2023 based on the same performance and service conditions as non- executive employees. Formal invitations to participate in this plan will be issued in coming months and will be accompanied by relevant ASX disclosures.\\nCEO COMMENTS\\nQantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said: \\\"Most of Australia was in lockdown for several months of the first half, so the loss we've announced today isn't surprising but it is frustrating.\\n\\\"We saw a sharp rebound in travel demand when borders started opening in November and December, only to be hit by the Omicron wave and all the uncertainty that came with it.\\n\\\"The uncertainty carried over into January but demand has started to recover as Australia adjusts to truly living with COVID. Our frequent flyer surveys show the intent to travel is extremely high and we're seeing good leisure demand into the fourth quarter. We've also seen a sharp uptick in international ticket sales in the past few weeks.\\n\\\"Predictions in a pandemic are naturally fraught, so we always forecast according to the best information we have but with the agility to adjust as needed. The fact we have all our Australian-based employees back at work means it makes sense for us to fly where it's cash positive to do so.\\n\\\"Despite all the uncertainty, we finished the first half with net debt back inside our target range and with strong liquidity, meaning we can start to look further ahead at strategic decisions on fleet, network and growth opportunities.\\n\\\"We're on track to deliver more than $900 million in annualised savings through restructuring by the end of FY22, which is ahead of schedule and means we're able to recover faster and perform better than a pre- COVID Qantas Group could have.\\n\\\"The challenge of COVID hasn't obscured the challenge of sustainability and emissions. Since January, we've been adding sustainable aviation fuel into our flights from London and we're on the cusp of doing the same out of the US. We'll have a significant update on our plans for emissions reduction next month.\\n\\\"We're very conscious of the support and patience shown by customers and shareholders as we all wait for travel conditions to stabilise. In the meantime, we've done a lot of work to put this company in the best possible position to deliver.\\n\\\"Employees across the Qantas Group have lived through enormous challenge and uncertainty over the past two years. Many have been stood down for extended periods of time and we've asked them to accept a wage freeze to help our company get through an unprecedented crisis that many other airlines didn't survive.\\n\\\"I'm pleased that we're able to offer our people a direct stake in the national carrier through a reward and retention program. It means those who help us through the recovery can share in the success, just as they have in the past.\\\"\\nOUTLOOK\\nWhile travel demand is strengthening and there have been positive developments on international borders in recent weeks, Omicron is likely to negatively impact Group EBIT by an estimated $650 million in 2H22.\\nKey assumptions for FY22 are:\\nGroup Domestic capacity expected to be 68 per cent of pre-COVID levels in 3Q22, increasing to 90- 100 per cent in 4Q22.   \\nGroup International capacity expected to be 22 per cent of pre-COVID levels in 3Q22, increasing to 44 per cent in 4Q22.   \\nNet capital expenditure (excluding land proceeds) in FY22 is expected to be $850 million.   \\nUnderlying depreciation and amortisation in FY22 is expected to be $1.8 billion.   \\nRecovery and restructuring program expected to achieve greater than $900 million in annualised benefits by FY22.   \\nNet debt expected to be within target range by end of FY22.   \\nLeisure travel will continue to lead domestic recovery, with good demand expected into 4Q22.   \\nCorporate travel demand outlook remains unchanged. Recovery delayed due to Omicron and now expected to commence with return to office activities in key states from March 2022.   \\nhttps://investor.qantas.com/FormBuilder/_Resource/_module/doLLG5ufYkCyEPjF1tpgyw/file/2022HY/1H22-Media-Release.pdf\\nQatar Airways\\nAbout Qatar Airways\\nQatar Airways is proud to be one of the youngest global airlines to serve all six continents, and thanks to our customers' response to our offerings, we are also the world's fastest-growing airline.

Carrying 149m guests p.a. (pre Covid-19) on more than 2,100 daily flights from 74 bases, the Group connects over 240 destinations in 40 countries on a fleet of 470 aircraft, with a further 210 Boeing 737s on order, which will enable the Ryanair Group to lower fares and grow traffic to 200m p.a. over the next 5 or 6 years. Ryanair has a team of over 16,000 highly skilled aviation professionals delivering Europe's No.1 on-time performance, and an industry leading 35-year safety record. Ryanair is Europe's cleanest greenest airline group and customers switching to fly Ryanair can reduce their CO\\u2082 emissions by up to 50% compared to the other Big 4 EU major airlines.\\nhttps://corporate.ryanair.com/ryanair-facts-and-figures/\\n25 July 2022\\nRYANAIR REPORTS Q1 PAT OF \\u20ac170M AS TRAFFIC RECOVERS STRONGLY POST-COVID BUT AT LOWER FARES\\nRyanair Holdings today (25 July) reported a Q1 PAT of \\u20ac170m (pre-exceptional), compared to a prior year Q1 loss of \\u20ac273m, but well below the \\u20ac243m PAT reported in Q1 FY20 (pre-Covid).\\nDuring this quarter;\\nQ1 traffic recovered strongly to 45.5m from 8.1m (+9% ahead of pre-Covid).   \\nEaster bookings & fares badly damaged by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Feb.   \\nSustainalytics1 ranked Ryanair the No.1 EU airline & No.2 World airline for ESG.   \\n73 B737-8200 \\\"Gamechangers\\\" delivered ahead of peak S.22.   \\nS.22 capacity on sale at 115% of S.19 (pre-Covid) levels.   \\nFY24 fuel hedging increased to 30% (FY23: 80%).   \\nNet debt reduced to \\u20ac0.4bn at 30 Jun. (31 Mar.: \\u20ac1.45bn).   \\nMajority of A320 leases now extended by up to 4 years to 2028.   \\nRyanair's Michael O'Leary, said:\\nENVIRONMENT:\\n\\\"Ryanair puts sustainability at the heart of our growth. This summer we are operating 73 new B737 \\\"Gamechanger\\\" aircraft, delivering 4% more seats yet burning 16% less fuel and cutting noise emissions by up to 40%. Passengers flying across Europe who switch to Ryanair (from high-fare legacy airlines) can reduce their environmental footprint by up to 50% per flight, proving that with Ryanair, growth can be coupled with more sustainability, leading to a better future for all our guests and their families.\\nWe continue to work hard to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). We are investing in our partnership with Trinity College Dublin's Sustainable Aviation Research Centre, and in April we announced a partnership with Neste to power up to one third of all our flights from Schiphol Airport (AMS) with a 40% SAF blend. Ryanair hopes to power 12.5% of our flights using SAF and cut our CO\\u2082 per pax/km by 10% to 60 grams by 2030. We are working with A4E, and the EU, to accelerate reform of the Single European Sky to improve ATC efficiency and reduce flight delays, which will substantially reduce fuel consumption, CO\\u2082 emissions and flight delays.\\nIn April, Sustainalytics ranked Ryanair the No.1 airline in Europe (No.2 globally) for ESG performance. Building on this achievement, in June we submitted Ryanair's commitment letter to SBTi2 and will work with them over the next 2 years to verify our ambitious targets. Today, we launch our updated (2022) \\\"Aviation with Purpose\\\" sustainability report highlighting ambitious environmental and social targets over the coming years and mapping out Ryanair's path to net carbon zero by 2050.\\nSOCIAL:\\nOur growth plans to 2026 will see Ryanair create over 6,000 well paid jobs for highly skilled aviation professionals across Europe. Over the next 3 years, we plan to expand our state-of-the-art training centres, investing over \\u20ac100m in 2 more, high skills, training facilities (one on the Iberian Peninsula, and one in CEE). This summer we take delivery of the first of 8 new CAE full flight simulators (value over $80m). We continue to invest heavily in our engineering and maintenance teams and recently announced a new maintenance hangar facility in Malta, in addition to newly opened hangars in Kaunas (Lithuania) and Shannon (Ireland). These in- house facilities enable us to create cadet and apprenticeship opportunities for school leavers, bringing through the next generation of highly skilled aviators and aircraft maintenance professionals.\\nFollowing the beginning of the post-Covid recovery in air travel this Spring, we moved quickly with our Trade Unions to negotiate accelerated pay restoration agreements, so that we can restore previously agreed pay cuts with all our people as soon as our business returns to pre-Covid levels. To date, accelerated pay restoration agreements have been agreed with Unions representing over 80% of our pilots and approx. 70% of our cabin crews across Europe. We hope to conclude agreements with the small remaining balance in the near future. We and our Trade Union partners, are committed to completing the restoration of these agreed pay cuts, which enabled Ryanair and our Union partners to minimise job losses during the Covid-19 pandemic, at a time when our competitor airlines cut thousands of high skilled jobs.\\nIn Q1, our Customer Panel held their latest meeting at Ryanair's Lab in Madrid. Building on their feedback, Labs will introduce further service improvements over the coming months, including auto check-in and airport express to facilitate faster journeys through airports. While CSAT scores dipped this quarter, due to the impact of ongoing ATC delays on punctuality and lengthy airport security wait times, we still recorded a strong 83% rating (with crew friendliness coming in at over 90%).\\nGOVERNANCE:\\nTo facilitate orderly NED succession, Julie O'Neill will not seek re-election at the upcoming AGM and has decided to retire from the Board in Sept. Our Chairman, Stan McCarthy, Board colleagues and management thank Julie for 9 years of stellar service to Ryanair. R\\u00f3is\\u00edn Brennan will take over as Chair of Remco when Julie departs in September.\\nOP. PERFORMANCE & GROWTH:\\nOur decision to work with our unions and agree pay cuts to minimise job losses (and keep crews current) throughout the 2 years of Covid was vindicated in recent months, as many European airlines, airports, and handling companies struggled to restore jobs that were cut during the pandemic. Ryanair seems unusual among the major EU airlines in Summer 22, insofar as we are fully crewed, despite operating at 115% of our pre-Covid capacity. Our business, our schedules and our customers are being disrupted by unprecedented ATC and airport handling delays, but we remain confident that we can operate almost 100% of our scheduled flights, while minimising delays and disruptions for our guests and their families.\\nOver the past 2-years, numerous airlines went bankrupt and many legacy carriers (incl. Alitalia, TAP, SAS and LOT) only survived by significantly reducing their fleets and passenger capacity, while receiving multi-billion-euro State Aid packages. These structural capacity reductions have created enormous growth opportunities for Ryanair to deploy our new, fuel efficient, B737 Gamechangers and our market share has increased significantly across major markets in Europe. With Boeing scheduled to deliver over 50 more Gamechangers ahead of S.23, we continue to recruit and train substantial numbers of pilots, cabin crew and engineers. Approx. 50% of S.23 capacity is now on sale and we recently announced a new base in Belfast Intl. (S.23), a 4th based aircraft in Venice (W.22) and the commencement of flights from Bologna-Forli (W.22). Thanks to our 210 B737 order book, and available fleet capacity, the Ryanair Group expects to grow from 149m (pre-Covid) passengers to over 225m p.a. by FY26\\nQ1 FY23 BUSINESS REVIEW:\\nRevenue & Costs\\nQ1 scheduled revenues increased 720% to \\u20ac1.58bn. While traffic recovered strongly from 8.1m to 45.5m passengers (at a 92% load factor), Russia's invasion of Ukraine in Feb. damaged Easter bookings and fares. As such, ave. fares were down 4% on the same quarter pre-Covid. Ancillary revenue continues to perform strongly, as traffic builds, delivering over \\u20ac22.50 per passenger. Total revenues increased by 600% to \\u20ac2.6bn.\\nWhile sectors increased by almost 330% and traffic rose 460%, operating costs rose just 250% to \\u20ac2.38bn (incl. a significant 560% increase in fuel to \\u20ac1bn), driven by lower variable costs such as airport & handling, ownership & maintenance and improved fuel burn as 73 Gamechangers entered the fleet ahead of peak S.22 (offset by the higher cost of jet fuel and route charges). Lower costs, coupled with higher load factors, saw (ex-fuel) unit cost per passenger drop to \\u20ac30.\\nhedging has increased to 30% at approx. $92bbl. Carbon credits are over 90% hedged for FY23 at \\u20ac55 (well below the current spot price of c.\\u20ac90). This hedge position helps insulate Ryanair against the spiralling cost of fuel, and provides Ryanair with a significant competitive advantage, particularly into W.22.\\nFollowing a recent review of B737NG op. lease opportunities and Boeing's failure to agree competitive pricing on a new aircraft order, the Group decided instead, to extend most of our Lauda A320 leases. This process, which is close to completion, will see these leases extended by up to 4 years (until 2028), locking in material rent savings, enhance operational efficiency and facilitate growth opportunities over the coming years.\\nBalance Sheet & Liquidity\\nRyanair's balance sheet is one of the strongest in the industry with a BBB (stable) credit rating (S&P and Fitch). Net debt at 30 June fell to \\u20ac0.4bn (\\u20ac1.45bn at 31 Mar.), and over 90% of the Group's fleet of B737s are unencumbered. Despite peak capex this year and next, we still expect to improve the balance sheet to a broadly zero net debt position over the next 2 years. The strength of our balance sheet ensures that the Group is well positioned to exploit the many growth opportunities that exist in a post-Covid Europe.\\nOUTLOOK:\\nWhile we remain hopeful that the high rate of vaccinations in Europe will allow the airline and tourism industry to fully recover and finally put Covid behind us, we cannot ignore the risk of new Covid variants in Autumn 2022. Our experience with Omicron last Nov., and the Ukraine invasion in Feb., shows how fragile the air travel market remains, and the strength of any recovery will be hugely dependent upon there being no adverse or unexpected developments over the remainder of FY23.\\nWhile there are clear signs of pent-up demand, bookings remain closer-in than was the norm (pre-Covid) at this time of year. We have limited visibility into the second half of Q2 and almost zero visibility into H2, when we are typically loss making. At this time, Q2 ave. fares are tracking ahead of peak S.19 (pre-Covid) levels by a low double-digit percentage. Ryanair plans to grow FY23 traffic to 165m (+11% on pre-Covid traffic) and will pursue its load active, yield passive strategy to achieve this growth. Despite being one of the best hedged airlines in Europe, high oil prices will lead to increased costs on our 20% unhedged fuel for the remainder of FY23. Given our later booking profile, the lack of visibility, volatile oil prices, potential Covid, geopolitical and supply chain risks, it is too soon to provide meaningful FY23 PAT guidance at this time. We hope to be in a better position to do so at the half year results in Nov. but, as our experience with Omicron last Nov. and Ukraine in Feb. shows, any guidance is subject to a very rapid change from unexpected events which are well beyond our control during what remains a very strong but still fragile recovery.\\\"\\nhttps://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Q1-FY23-Results.pdf\\nSingapore Airlines (SGX:C6L)\\nSingapore Airlines (SIA or SQ) is the flag carrier airline of Singapore, with its hub at Singapore Changi Airport.\\nAbout Singapore Airlines\\nFirst formed in 1972, Singapore's flag carrier airline is best known for its multiple travel accolades and impeccable service standards, embodied in its kebaya (traditional nonya dress)-clad flight attendants (famously known as the Singapore Girl).\\nStellar service is just one of a host of reasons that makes Singapore Airlines a world-class travel brand.

The Group passenger capacity reached 80% of pre-Covid-191 levels in December 2022, higher than the average of 51%2 for the Asia-Pacific region. SIA and Scoot carried 7.4 million passengers in the third quarter, up 17% from the second quarter. The Group carried 18.8 million passengers during the nine months ended 31 December 2022, up nine-fold from a year before. Passenger load factors for the Group improved 0.8 percentage points to 87.4%, the highest for any quarter, on the back of record load factors for both SIA (87.3%) and Scoot (87.8%).\\nThe cargo segment's performance moderated compared to the previous quarter due to softening demand, as well as an increase in bellyhold capacity as more passenger aircraft returned to service globally. While yields were weaker quarter-on- quarter, they remained elevated - almost double - compared to pre-Covid-191 levels.\\nAs a result, Group revenue for the three months to 31 December rose $358 million (+8.0%) quarter-on-quarter to $4,846 million. This is a record quarterly revenue for the Group. Passenger flown revenue increased by $463 million (+14.0%) to $3,767 million as traffic grew 12.2% for the quarter, outpacing the 11.1% expansion in capacity. Revenue per available seat-kilometre (RASK) was 10.6 cents, the highest quarterly RASK in the Group's history. Cargo flown revenue fell $141 million (-14.1%) to $862 million, with the lower yields (-14.6%) partially mitigated by a slight uptick in loads (+0.6%).\\nExpenditure grew by $281 million (+7.4%) quarter-on-quarter to $4,091 million. This comprised a $371 million rise in non-fuel expenditure (+15.5%) that was partly offset by a $90 million decrease (-6.3%) in net fuel cost. The increase in non-fuel expenditure was higher than the increase in capacity, mainly driven by higher foreign exchange losses (+$194 million) recorded at the end of the current quarter with the US dollar weakening 6.1% against the Singapore dollar3. Net fuel cost fell to $1,333 million, mainly due to a 13% drop in fuel prices (-$226 million). This was partly offset by higher volumes uplifted (+$103 million) and lower fuel hedging gain (+$19 million).\\nThe Group posted an operating profit of $755 million for the third quarter, up $77 million (+11.4%) from the previous quarter. Operating profit for SIA was $48 million (-7.0%) lower quarter-on-quarter at $636 million. This was largely due to higher non-fuel expenditure (-$340 million), mainly driven by a foreign exchange loss in the current quarter versus foreign exchange gain in the previous quarter (-$229 million), and partly mitigated by higher operating revenue (+$182 million) as well as lower net fuel cost (+$110 million). Scoot achieved a record quarterly operating profit of $135 million, up $123 million or more than 11-fold from the previous quarter. The low-cost carrier's operating revenue surged to a record $592 million (+$145 million), significantly outpacing the increase in operating expenditure (-$22 million).\\nThe strong performance by both SIA and Scoot is a testament to the success of the Group's portfolio strategy, which enables it to effectively capture growth in different traffic segments by deploying the right vehicles to the right markets.\\nThe Group posted a net profit of $628 million, $71 million higher (+12.7%) from the previous quarter. This was due to the better operating performance (+$77 million), net interest income in the current quarter versus net finance charges in the previous quarter (+$71 million), and partially offset by a higher tax expense (-$90 million).\\nApril to December 2022 - Profit and Loss\\nRevenues rose $8,120 million (+157.9%) year-on-year to $13,263 million, the highest nine-month revenue for the SIA Group. Passenger flown revenue increased $8,160 million (+514.5%) as traffic grew seven-fold, outpacing the 108.9% expansion in capacity. RASK reached 10.1 cents (+197.1%), a record nine-month figure for the Group. Cargo flown revenue reduced $265 million (-8.2%) due to decline in cargo loads (-10.6%) while mitigated by higher yields (+2.7%).\\nExpenditure grew by $5,588 million (+98.3%) year-on-year to $11,274 million. This consisted of a $2,586 million jump (+179.2%) in net fuel cost, a $2,924 million increase (+67.7%) in non-fuel expenditure, and the absence of the $78 million gain that the Group recorded last year for fair value changes on fuel derivatives. Net fuel cost rose to $4,029 million, mainly from a 70% increase in fuel prices (+$1,866 million) and higher volumes uplifted (+$1,097 million), and partially offset by higher fuel hedging gains (-$505 million). The increase in non-fuel expenditure was lower than the increase in passenger capacity.\\nThe Group recorded an operating profit of $1,989 million for the nine months to December 2022, versus a $543 million loss a year before (+$2,532 million). Net profits rose to a record $1,555 million, reversing the $752 million loss in the previous year (+$2,307 million). This was due to the better operating performance (+$2,532 million) and lower net finance charges (+$194 million), partially offset by a tax expense versus a tax credit a year before (-$438 million).\\nBalance Sheet\\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Group shareholders' equity was $19.4 billion, a reduction of $3.0 billion from 31 March 2022 following the redemption in December 2022 of the Mandatory Convertible Bonds that were issued in June 2020. Total debt balances increased by $0.4 billion to $16.1 billion, mainly due to the increase in lease liabilities as a result of sale-and-leaseback activities. Consequently, the Group's debt- equity ratio rose from 0.70 times to 0.83 times.\\nCash and bank balances saw an increase of $1.6 billion to $15.4 billion, primarily due to net cash generated from operations including proceeds from forward sales. In addition to the cash on hand, the Group retains access to $2.2 billion of committed lines of credit, all of which remain undrawn.\\nFLEET DEVELOPMENT\\nDuring the third quarter, two Boeing 737-8 narrowbody aircraft4 joined SIA's operating fleet after their post-delivery cabin retrofit.\\nAs of 31 December 2022, SIA's operating fleet comprised 133 passenger aircraft5 and seven freighters, while Scoot had 55 passenger aircraft6 in its operating fleet. With an average age of six years and six months, the Group operates one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the airline industry7. This allows the Group to continue offering world-class products and services to customers, while pursuing operating efficiencies and significantly reducing its carbon emissions.\\nSIA is expected to take delivery of one Airbus A350-900 and one Boeing 787-10 in the fourth quarter, with the aircraft joining the operating fleet in the next financial year.\\nScoot plans to add nine new Embraer E190-E2 aircraft to its fleet, complementing its larger Airbus A320 Family and Boeing 787 aircraft. These 112-seat planes will enable Scoot to increase its network connectivity by serving thinner routes to non-metro destinations. The first aircraft is scheduled for delivery in 2024, and the remaining eight are to be progressively introduced by the end of 2025. This investment underscores the SIA Group's confidence in the growing demand for air travel in the region, and supports its wider fleet and network expansion strategy at the portfolio level.\\nNETWORK DEVELOPMENT\\nDuring the third quarter, SIA and Scoot stepped up services to meet the strong travel demand during the year-end holiday season. With the relaxation of travel restrictions to selected key markets, the Group reinstated services to destinations in China and Indonesia, and added frequencies to Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei, and points in Japan. Scoot resumed operations to Hokkaido (Sapporo), offering scheduled services via Taipei as well as direct seasonal services until February 2023. As of 31 December 2022, the Group's passenger network8 covered 111 destinations in 36 countries and territories. SIA served 76 destinations and Scoot served 57 destinations. The cargo network8 comprised 116 destinations in 38 countries and territories.\\nThe SIA Group is resuming services to China as this key market opens up to international travel. Currently, SIA and Scoot serve a total of 149 destinations in China compared to 25 points pre-pandemic.\\nDuring the current quarter, Scoot expanded its Indonesia network with the launch of flights to Balikpapan. For the Northern Summer operating season (26 March 2023 to 28 October 2023), Scoot will expand its services to China with flight resumptions to Haikou, Nanning, Ningbo, Shenyang, and Xi'an, and step up frequencies to Athens, Langkawi, Manado, Perth, Taipei-Tokyo (Narita), and Taipei-Hokkaido (Sapporo). SIA will mount supplementary flights to Barcelona, Frankfurt, and Rome during the 2023 summer peak. Services to Busan will resume in August 2023. Scoot's services to Gold Coast and SIA's services to Vancouver will be suspended with effect from July 2023 and October 2023 respectively, as the Group adjusts its capacity in response to demand.\\nGroup capacity is projected to reach an average of around 77% of pre- Covid-191 levels in the fourth quarter of FY2022/23.\\nPREPARING FOR THE FUTURE\\nSIA and Tata Sons (Tata) reached an agreement in November 2022 to merge Air India and Vistara, with SIA investing a further $360 million in Air India as part of the transaction. This transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. When completed, it will reinforce SIA's partnership with Tata and give it a 25.1% stake in the enlarged Air India group. The merged entity will be four to five times larger in scale compared to Vistara, with a strong presence in all key airline segments in India. The proposed merger will bolster SIA's presence in India, strengthen its multi-hub strategy, and allow it to continue participating directly in this large and fast-growing aviation market.\\nDeeper collaboration with like-minded airlines is an integral part of the SIA Group's partnerships strategy. This enables SIA and its partners to drive more traffic to their hubs, offer more options to customers, and increase the Group's global footprint.\\nIn November 2022, Virgin Australia resumed the sale of codeshare flights to 42 destinations in 23 countries and territories across SIA's network, enabling more seamless travel for customers between Australia, Asia, Africa, and Europe. In December 2022, Thai Airways International (THAI) and SIA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to deepen their commercial collaboration. In the initial phase, THAI and SIA will codeshare on their respective flights between Singapore and Bangkok. THAI will also put its code on SIA's flights to destinations in South Africa and the Americas in 2023, subject to regulatory approval. Earlier this month, Vietnam Airlines and SIA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to strengthen the commercial cooperation between the two airlines, including exploring codeshare arrangements between Singapore and Vietnam and potentially other destinations in the SIA network.\\nOUTLOOK\\nThe demand for air travel is expected to be robust in the fourth quarter, supported by the recovery in East Asia as travel restrictions ease across China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan. Forward sales remain strong across all markets for both leisure and business travel, as well as all cabin classes. The Group will continue to monitor the demand for air travel, and adjust its capacity accordingly.\\nDemand for air freight is expected to face headwinds, in addition to the seasonally weaker fourth quarter. This is due to macroeconomic concerns, and a slowdown in new orders as importers trim inventory levels. The increase in bellyhold cargo capacity will also increase the pressure on cargo yields.\\nThe airline industry continues to face geopolitical challenges, slowing economic growth, high cost inflation, and elevated fuel prices. Competition is likely to intensify as airlines inject more capacity on international routes. The SIA Group's robust financial position, its commitment to offer customers best-in-class products and services, as well as its enhanced agility and resilience emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic, will allow it to retain its leadership position in the industry.\\nFor the full financial report, see:   https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/Investor-Relations/Financial-Results/SGXNET/bu-q3fy2223.pdf\\nSouthwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV)\\nCompany Overview\\nIn its 50th year of service, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) continues to differentiate itself from other air carriers with exemplary Customer Service delivered by nearly 58,000 Employees to a Customer base that topped 130 million passengers in 2019. Southwest has the nation's most robust point-to-point, non-stop route network, with a strong presence in top leisure and business markets. In peak travel seasons during 2019, Southwest operated more than 4,000 weekday departures among a network of 101 destinations in the United States and 10 additional countries. In 2020, the carrier added service to Hilo, Hawaii; Cozumel, Mexico; Miami; and Palm Springs, Calif. Southwest will begin service to two new seasonal destinations in Colorado, Steamboat Springs, and Montrose (Telluride and Crested Butte) on Dec. 19, 2020. In 2021, Southwest will begin service to both Chicago (O'Hare) and Sarasota/Bradenton on Feb. 14; both Savannah/Hilton Head and Colorado Springs on March 11; Houston (Bush) on April 12; and Jackson, Miss. on June 6.\\nThe carrier has announced an intention to add service in the second quarter of 2021 in Fresno and Santa Barbara. Southwest is leveraging additional airports in or near cities where its Customer base is large, along with adding easier access to popular leisure-oriented destinations from across its domestic-focused network. Southwest coined Transference\\u00ae to describe its purposed philosophy of treating Customers honestly and fairly, and low fares actually staying low. Southwest is the only major U.S. airline to offer bags fly free\\u00ae to everyone (first and second checked pieces of luggage, size and weight limits apply, some carriers offer free checked bags on select routes or in qualified circumstances), and there are no change fees, though fare differences might apply.\\nSouthwest has a long history of returning value to its Shareholders. Since 2010, Southwest has returned more than $12.9 billion to Shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, through March 31, 2020. In first quarter 2020, Southwest returned $639 million to Shareholders through the repurchase of $451 million in common stock and the payment of $188 million in dividends.\\nDividends and share repurchase programs are currently suspended due to the negative financial effects from the COVID-19 pandemic. From its first flights on June 18, 1971, Southwest Airlines launched an era of unprecedented affordability in air travel described by the U.S. Department of Transportation as \\\"The Southwest Effect,\\\" a lowering of fares and increase in passenger traffic wherever the carrier serves. With 47 consecutive years of profitability through 2019, Southwest is one of the most honoured airlines in the world, known for a triple bottom line approach that contributes to the carrier's performance and productivity, the importance of its People and the communities they serve, and an overall commitment to efficiency and the planet.\\nhttp://www.southwestairlinesinvestorrelations.com/our-company/company-overview\\n26 January 2023\\nSouthwest Airlines Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results\\nSouthwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) (the \\\"Company\\\") today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results:\\nFourth quarter net loss of $220 million, or $0.37 loss per diluted share   \\nFourth quarter net loss, excluding special items1, of $226 million, or $0.38 loss per diluted share   \\nFull year net income of $539 million, or $0.87 per diluted share   \\nFull year net income, excluding special items, of $723 million, or $1.16 per diluted share   \\nRecord fourth quarter and full year operating revenues of $6.2 billion and $23.8 billion, respectively   \\nLiquidity2 of $13.3 billion, well in excess of debt outstanding of $8.1 billion   \\nBob Jordan, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \\\"Due to the operational disruptions in late December, which resulted in more than 16,700 flight cancellations, we incurred a fourth quarter pre-tax negative impact of approximately $800 million (or approximately $620 million on an after-tax basis), which resulted in a fourth quarter 2022 net loss. Despite the negative financial impacts in first quarter 2022 due to the Omicron variant and in fourth quarter 2022 due to the operational disruptions, we generated full year 2022 net income, excluding special items, of $723 million.\\n\\\"With regard to the operational disruptions, I am deeply sorry for the impact to our Employees and Customers. We have swiftly taken steps to bolster our operational resilience and are undergoing a detailed review of the December events. In addition, our Board of Directors has established an Operations Review Committee that is working with the Company's Management to help oversee the Company's response. As part of our efforts, we are also conducting a third-party review of the December events and are reexamining the priority of technology and other investments planned in 2023.\\n\\\"Based on current revenue and cost trends, we currently expect a first quarter 2023 net loss. However, we are encouraged by current booking trends in March 2023. Our 2023 plan continues to support solid profits with year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. We remain intent on achieving the long-term financial goals outlined at our December 2022 Investor Day. We also intend to regain our 51-year reputation for operational excellence. As ever, I am grateful for our Employees and their resilience and steadfast focus on Safety, Customer Service, and Teamwork. They remain the heart and soul of Southwest Airlines.\\\"\\nGuidance and Outlook\\nThe following tables introduce or update selected financial guidance for first quarter and full year 2023, as applicable:\\nRevenue Results and Outlook:\\nRecord fourth quarter 2022 operating revenues of $6.2 billion, a 7.7 percent increase compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nRecord full year 2022 operating revenues of $23.8 billion, a 6.2 percent increase compared with full year 2019   \\nFourth quarter 2022 operating revenues per available seat mile (RASM, or unit revenues) increased 14.9 percent driven primarily by record fourth quarter passenger yields, which increased 10.6 percent, coupled with a load factor increase of 0.4 points, all compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nFourth quarter 2022 managed business revenues were down 20 percent compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nWhile the Company's fourth quarter 2022 operating revenues were negatively impacted by approximately $410 million due to the flight cancellations in December, the Company's revenue performance leading up to the operational disruptions was strong and trending in line with previous guidance. Despite the flight cancellations, the Company had record fourth quarter operating revenues. As expected, fourth quarter 2022 managed business revenues remained below 2019 levels. The Company experienced sequential improvement from October to November, resulting in fourth quarter 2022 managed business revenues down 20 percent, compared with fourth quarter 2019, in line with previous guidance. In addition, the Company's fourth quarter 2022 operating revenues benefited from its loyalty program, including elevated point redemptions for flights and incremental revenue from its co-brand credit card agreement, as well as a continuation of increased take-rates for Upgraded Boarding following the digital self-service launch in August 2022.\\nThus far in January 2023, the Company has experienced an increase in flight cancellations and a deceleration in bookings, primarily for January and February 2023 travel, which are assumed to be associated with the operational disruptions in December 2022. As a result, the Company currently estimates a negative revenue impact in the range of $300 million to $350 million in first quarter 2023. Encouragingly, booking trends have improved sequentially this month, including notable strength in Rapid Rewards\\u00ae redemptions. Currently, March 2023 leisure booking and yield trends appear strong, and are trending in line with the Company's expectations at the time of its Investor Day in early December 2022. The recent improvements in close-in booking trends are encouraging, and the Company currently expects March 2023 managed business revenues to be roughly restored to March 2019 levels.\\nFuel Costs and Outlook:\\nFourth quarter 2022 fuel costs were $3.18 per gallon1\\u2014in line with previous guidance\\u2014and included $0.03 per gallon in premium expense and $0.35 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts   \\nFull year 2022 fuel costs were $3.07 per gallon1\\u2014in line with previous guidance\\u2014and included $0.04 per gallon in premium expense and $0.49 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts   \\nFourth quarter 2022 fuel efficiency improved 2.0 percent compared with fourth quarter 2019 due to more Boeing 737-8 aircraft, the Company's most fuel-efficient aircraft, as a percentage of its total fleet   \\nAs of January 20, 2023, the fair market value of the Company's fuel derivative contracts settling in 2023 and 2024 was an asset of $561 million   \\nThe Company's multi-year fuel hedging program continues to provide insurance against spikes in energy prices and significantly offset the market price increase, year-over-year, in jet fuel in fourth quarter and full year 2022. The Company's current fuel derivative contracts contain a combination of instruments based in West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil. The economic fuel price per gallon sensitivities3 provided in the table below assume the relationship between Brent crude oil and refined products based on market prices as of January 20, 2023.\\nNon-Fuel Costs and Outlook:\\nFourth quarter 2022 operating expenses of $6.6 billion, a 29.5 percent increase compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nFourth quarter 2022 operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profit sharing, increased 35.9 percent compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nFourth quarter 2022 CASM-X increased 44.9 percent compared with fourth quarter 2019   \\nFull year 2022 CASM-X increased 22.1 percent compared with full year 2019   \\nAccrued $127 million of profit sharing expense for 2022 for the benefit of Employees   \\nThe significant increase in fourth quarter 2022 CASM-X, compared with fourth quarter 2019, was largely due to the negative financial impacts of the December 2022 operational disruptions. The Company incurred a net increase of approximately $390 million in operating expenses due to the December 2022 operational disruptions\\u2014an additional 23-point CASM-X growth headwind compared with fourth quarter 2019. The majority of the 23-point CASM-X increase was due to travel expense reimbursements to Customers and the estimated value of Rapid Rewards\\u00ae points offered as a gesture of goodwill to Customers and that are expected to be redeemed, with the remainder of the increase driven primarily by premium pay and additional compensation for Employees. Excluding the impact from the operational disruptions, the Company's fourth quarter 2022 CASM-X growth rate was trending roughly 4 points higher than the high end of its previous guidance range of up 14 percent to 18 percent, compared with fourth quarter 2019, primarily due to an increase in labor accruals for the Company's open labor contracts. The Company continues to monitor relative market compensation to evaluate its labor accruals in an effort to provide competitive market-based compensation packages for its Employees.\\nThe Company continues to experience year-over-year inflationary and other cost pressures in first quarter 2023, in particular from higher labor rates and accruals for all Employee work groups, as well as higher rate estimates for benefits and airport costs. The Company currently expects its first quarter 2023 CASM-X to increase in the range of 2 percent to 4 percent, year-over-year\\u2014approximately two points higher than its previous guidance of flat to up 2 percent, year-over year. Half of the two-point increase is attributable to a continuation of premium pay in January 2023 related to the December 2022 operational disruptions, and the remainder of the increase is primarily due to an increase in labor accruals for the Company's open labor contracts.\\nThe Company currently expects its full year 2023 CASM-X to decrease in the range of 6 percent to 8 percent, year-over-year\\u2014approximately five points lower than its previous guidance to decrease in the range of 1 percent to 3 percent, year-over-year. The vast majority of the five-point decrease in 2023 is due to the year-over-year impact from lower fourth quarter 2022 available seat miles and higher fourth quarter 2022 operating expenses than expected\\u2014both attributable to the December 2022 operational disruptions\\u2014offset slightly by an increase in 2023 labor accruals for the Company's open labor contracts. The Company plans to hire more than 7,000 new Employees, net of attrition, in 2023, a nearly 40 percent decrease from 2022 net hiring levels.\\nFourth quarter 2022 net interest expense, which is included in Other expenses, decreased $163 million, year-over-year, primarily due to a $109 million year-over-year increase in interest income driven primarily by higher interest rates, coupled with a $55 million year-over-year decrease in interest expense primarily due to various debt repurchases and repayments throughout 2022, as well as elimination of the debt discount as a result of the Company's adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, Debt\\u2014Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging\\u2014Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity.\\nCapacity, Fleet, and Capital Spending:\\nThe Company's full year 2022 capacity decreased 5.6 percent, compared with full year 2019, which was roughly one point lower than previous guidance of down 4.5 percent, due to flight cancellations from the December 2022 operational disruptions. Prior to the operational disruptions, the Company expected its 2023 capacity to increase approximately 15 percent, year-over-year. The Company's 2023 capacity growth plans currently remain unchanged. However, as a result of lower capacity in 2022, the Company's 2023 capacity is expected to increase in the range of 16 percent to 17 percent, year-over-year. As previously indicated, nearly all planned 2023 capacity additions will go to restoring the network and adding breadth and depth in existing Southwest markets.\\nThe Company received 33 Boeing 737-8 aircraft during fourth quarter 2022, including two additional -8 aircraft deliveries than previously planned, for a total of 68 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2022, compared with previous guidance of 66. The Company ended 2022 with 770 aircraft, which reflects 26 -700 aircraft retirements, including five retirements in fourth quarter. Due to Boeing's supply chain challenges and the current status of the -7 certification, the Company did not receive all 114 contractually scheduled 737 deliveries in 2022. The Company expects the remaining 46 contractual undelivered aircraft to shift into future years. Based on continued discussions with Boeing regarding the pace of expected deliveries, the Company continues to estimate it will receive approximately 100 737 aircraft deliveries in 2023, which differs from its contractual order book displayed in the table below. During first quarter 2023, the Company expects to receive approximately 30 -8 aircraft deliveries. The Company continues to expect to retire 27 -700 aircraft in 2023, including five -700 retirements in first quarter. As a result of the two additional -8 deliveries in fourth quarter 2022, the Company now expects to end 2023 with 843 aircraft, compared with its previous guidance of 841 aircraft.\\nThe Company's full year 2022 capital expenditures were $3.9 billion, relatively in line with the Company's guidance of $4.0 billion. The Company continues to estimate its 2023 capital spending to be in the range of $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion, which assumes approximately 100 737 aircraft deliveries in 2023. The Company's 2023 capital spending guidance continues to include approximately $1.2 billion in non-aircraft capital spending. Including both capital spending and operating expense budgets, the Company currently expects to spend approximately $1.3 billion in 2023 on technology investments, upgrades, and system maintenance.\\nSince the Company's previous Investor Day disclosure on December 7, 2022, the Company converted four 2023 -7 firm orders to -8 firm orders in fourth quarter 2022. Additionally, in January 2023, the Company exercised 10 -7 options for delivery in 2024. The following tables provide further information regarding the Company's contractual order book and compare its contractual order book as of January 26, 2023, with its previous order book as of December 7, 2022. For purposes of the delivery schedule below, the Company has included the remaining 46 of its 2022 contractual undelivered aircraft (14 -7s and 32 -8s) within its 2023 contractual commitments. Given current supply chain and aircraft delivery delays, the Company will continue working with Boeing to solidify future delivery dates.\\nLiquidity and Capital Deployment:\\nThe Company ended 2022 with $12.3 billion in cash and short-term investments and a fully available revolving credit line of $1.0 billion   \\nThe Company had a net cash position6 of $4.2 billion, and adjusted debt7 to invested capital8 (leverage)9 of 47 percent as of December 31, 2022   \\nThe Company paid $611 million during fourth quarter 2022 to retire debt and finance lease obligations, including the maturity of its 2.75% $300 million Notes due November 2022; the retirement of $191 million in principle related to a lease buyout transaction; the extinguishment of $103 million in principal of various unsecured notes for a cash payment of $104 million; and $16 million in scheduled debt payments   \\nThe Company paid $3.1 billion during full year 2022 to retire a total of $2.9 billion in principle of debt and finance lease obligations, compared with its previous guidance of $2.6 billion, due to the early repayment of fourth quarter 2022 extinguishments noted above   \\nAwards and Recognitions:\\nNamed to FORTUNE's list of World's Most Admired Companies for 2022; ranked #28   \\n#1 Marketing Carrier in Customer Satisfaction per the U.S. Department of Transportation   \\nNamed Loyalty Program of the Year for Rapid Rewards Program and recognized for providing the Best Loyalty Credit Card by the 2022 Freddie Awards; Received the 2022 Freddie Awards title of Best Customer Service   \\nNamed the top domestic airline for customer service by the 2022 Elliot Readers' Choice Customer Service Awards   \\nNamed a Top 100 Company in 2022 by BetterInvesting Magazine   \\nRanked #2 in the Best Airlines for 2022 list by The Points Guy   \\nNamed to Glassdoor's Best Places to Work list in 2022 for the 13th consecutive year   \\nNamed to the Best Employers for Diversity 2022 list by Forbes   \\nDesignated a 2022 Military Friendly Company by Viqtory   \\nNamed as A Best Place To Work For LGBTQ+ Equality in 2022 from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation   \\nDesignated one of the Best Companies for Latinos to Work 2022 by Latino Leaders Magazine   \\nNamed a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion after achieving a top score on Disability:IN's 2022 Disability Equality Index   \\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG):\\nPublished the Company's annual integrated corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability report\\u2014the Southwest Airlines One Report\\u2014a comprehensive, integrated report that includes information on the Company's Citizenship efforts and key topics including People, Performance, and Planet, along with reporting guided by the Global Reporting Initiatives (GRI) Standards, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) frameworks   \\nPublished the Southwest Airlines Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Report (DEI), a companion piece to the One Report.

On the 20th of May 1933, we took to the skies as State Airlines Administration. Leading the way, Turkey's first aviator and chief executive, Fesan Evrensev, set out with a mere 30 employees and 5 aircraft.\\nIn 1947, proudly flying the Turkish national flag, we conducted our first overseas flight, from Istanbul to Athens. Making headway in 1951, our fleet increased to 33 aircraft and we began to fly to new destinations: Nicosia, Beirut, and Cairo.\\nIn 1955, taking the name of Turkish Airlines, we signed a document listing our extraordinary achievements. Furthermore, our name gained its ranks alongside the members of IATA, International Air Transport Association.\\nThe construction of Istanbul Ye\\u015filk\\u00f6y Airport wrapped up in 1953 and opened to international air traffic. In 1985, it became Atat\\u00fcrk Airport, a global meeting point; a hub to thousands of memorable moments.\\nIn 1958, 5 Viscount 794 aircraft joined our fleet; After switching from piston engines to jet-powered aircraft, a new era dawned in our aviation history.\\nIn 1959, Mesut Manio\\u011flu designed our signature emblem, the wild goose, a fitting image as geese are known to fly up to an altitude of 9,000.\\nIn 1961, pilot captains Zihni Bar\\u0131n and Nurettin made another first in Turkish Airlines history by crossing the Atlantic Ocean on a F-27 aircraft on a 30-hour flight from the USA to Istanbul.\\nDue to the devoted efforts and the dedication of our workers, our capital increased from 200 million in 1972 to 400 million, an astounding 100% increase.\\nIn 1973, the first McDonnell Douglas DC-10 European aircraft was added to our fleet. A journey that began 40 years ago with 24 personnel experienced an employee network growth of 4,437.\\nThe firm belief in broadening our horizons ensured achievements that gave way to a thriving progression of our success story in the 80's. Since 1983, a fruitful 50 years, we have been bridging continents across the globe, delivering 2,5 million passengers. From Europe, the Middle East, and the Far East, we finally launched flights to America, with more than 5,000 employees on 4 continents serving our world-leading brand.\\nIn 1998, the Turkish Airlines website was launched. In 2001, we put our call centre into service. Purchasing tickets became a lot easier in 2003 with the application of e-tickets and check-in. Turkish Airlines corporate website launched with a new interface on turkishairlines.com.\\nCustomers can now view our website in English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, China and Russian amongst other languages.\\nIt currently takes less than a minute for customers to book tickets on our user-friendly mobile application that is visited by millions daily.\\nCustomer satisfaction is our top priority and we put the utmost care into ensuring that your journey runs as smoothly as possible.\\nIn 2000, we brought you Miles&Smiles, providing exclusive privileges.

Richard Branson's enthusiasm and cheeky personality reflected the airline's promise: we don't do ordinary.\\nSince then, Virgin Atlantic have become the UK's second largest carrier, helping customers to fly and connect all around the world, with non-stop transatlantic routes including New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Delhi, and Johannesburg. Plus, thanks to the joint venture with Delta, Air France, and KLM, over 350 cities across North America, Europe and the UK have now become accessible.\\nToday Virgin Atlantic's purpose is to embrace the human spirit and let it fly. This stems from our deeply rooted values - optimistic, inclusive, and adventurous. Abiding by these daily ensures we remain a 'Business for Good', helping to develop as innovators and providing customers with unique experiences.\\nTurning an ordinary like into an extraordinary love is one mission, with the other being 'Change is in the Air' - a new sustainability program, which sees Virgin Atlantic working with a number of charity partners and encouraging customers to offset their carbon.\\nhttps://www.virgin.com/virgin-companies/virgin-atlantic\\n26 March 2021\\nVirgin Atlantic Annual Report 2021\\nChairperson's statement\\n2020 was Virgin Atlantic's 36th year of continuous operation and the most difficult in the company's history. Covid-19 ruined lives and devastated economies globally. Aviation has been one of the worst affected industries, and within aviation, the long- haul sector, of which VAA is part, has been the most damaged.\\nFor more than 12 months now, we have been locked in a daily fight for survival. That we have come so far is due to the great qualities of leadership shown by our senior leadership team, led by Shai Weiss, to the unstinting and brave contributions of all our staff, and to the great support of our partners in business, who joined us in a successful and comprehensive solvent recapitalisation scheme in September last year. We are now planning on the basis of a phased exit to the pandemic in the second half of the year and a return to profitable operation in 2022.\\nThere is much to celebrate in this prospect, but this celebration has to be tempered by our sorrow and great regret for the human cost of our fight for survival. Enormously hard decisions have had to be taken to reduce operations and therefore make permanent headcount reductions, in order to survive. We are a significantly diminished team as a result. Our thoughts are with those affected, and our great thanks are due to them for their loyal service.\\nAt the end of February 2021, the UK Government published its roadmap to a progressive reopening of the economy and removal of social restrictions. This roadmap underpins our own plan to restart passenger services at scale in time for the second half of the year. However, much remains to be done in terms of planning to enable travel to resume fully. There are decisions to be taken about the requirements for Covid testing, passporting and certification.\\nVirgin Atlantic is completely focused on delivering a safe, secure and healthy environment for our staff and customers, and we have been working hard to assist Government in formulating practical and effective measures to deliver this. We will know more in April and May, after the Government's task force reports.\\nThe 2020 financial year was a story of vastly reduced flying, prodigious losses, financial restructuring to preserve liquidity, and operational restructuring to reduce our establishment in order to meet the new market environment.\\nPassenger numbers and revenue fell by 80%. We carried 1.2 million passengers compared to nearly 6 million in the previous year. Passenger revenue was \\u00a3446m compared to over \\u00a32bn in 2019. The only bright spot was the performance of our cargo operation which grew revenue by nearly 50% to \\u00a3319m, a remarkable achievement in the circumstances.\\nOur response to the crisis involved consolidating flight operations at Heathrow and Manchester, reducing our fleet and streamlining all areas of the company, which sadly also included a 41% reduction in our workforce by the end of 2020.\\nThe sudden and prolonged restrictions imposed on travel in March 2020 created enormous logistical difficulties for all passenger carriers, as literally millions of ticketed passengers sought to re-arrange or cancel flights in a short period of time, a contingency for which no operational plan existed.\\nWe ourselves refunded 220,000 bookings with more than \\u00a3600m between January and December. As was the case for all operators, we were not able to process the requests to the timescales normally in force, which we much regret.\\nHowever, we did catch up in the shortest time achievable, due to extraordinary efforts by the customer teams, and our procedures have been amended, to hopefully avoid a repetition of last year's problems.\\nThe first half of 2021 is all about the continuing fight for survival, as most long-haul routes remain closed. We continue to husband resources and to preserve cash. Following the roadmap announcement on 22 February, we look forward to a second half year of resumed operations at scale. There is even the prospect, if the roadmap timetable is adhered to, of more substantial flight operations re-starting at the end of May.\\nThe forecast that all UK adults aged over 18 will have been vaccinated by the end of July certainly underpins our optimism about reopening. Subject of course to that fundamental assumption, there are real grounds for optimism at\\nVirgin Atlantic.\\nWe have shown great agility in re-shaping the airline's operations and transforming the cost base. In 2022, we will make further progress towards our ambition to be the most loved travel company, while being sustainably profitable.\\nOn behalf of the whole Board and of our shareholders, I can safely say that the one truly bright aspect of an otherwise dreadful year in 2020 was the performance and commitment of our people. Whether in work or on furlough, all pulled together to support each other and the national effort to respond to Covid-19.\\nWe worked with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to repatriate UK citizens. We partnered with the Department of Health and the NHS to transport crucial medical supplies to the UK, including 7,000 tonnes of PPE, test kits and other medical supplies.\\nWhilst on furlough, more than 350 cabin crew volunteered to work at NHS Nightingale and other hospitals, the ambulance services and as NHS Volunteer Responders. Now, in the vaccination phase, our frontline staff with medical training are supporting the vaccine roll-out.\\nWe also owe great thanks to all our partners in business, our suppliers and our financiers. The support they have given our efforts to get through the crisis has been outstanding. At Virgin Atlantic, a core objective is to be \\\"best in partnering\\\"; I believe that the deep trust evidenced by the support of all concerned in our restructuring last September is a testament to the value of our approach to business over the years.\\n2020 was a very difficult year for very many company boards, and ours was no exception. I thank all my Board colleagues for their great contribution. I also welcome Klaus Heinemann as independent Board Observer, on behalf of our creditors. Klaus has a wealth of aviation experience, having previously served as CEO of Aercap and as Chair of Finnair. During the year, Tom Mackay, our CFO, and Ian de Sousa, our Company Secretary of more than 20 years, stepped down. We give them our great thanks and very best wishes for the future.\\nIn conclusion, on behalf of the Board and shareholders, I give our most profound thanks and appreciation to every employee of Virgin Atlantic. This has been the hardest year for very many of us and our families, and the spirit and dedication you have displayed is remarkable. Survival depended on it.\\nThrough this dark period, the contribution of the leadership team and the inspiration they have given to us all has been amazing. Shai Weiss our CEO has epitomised the Virgin ethos. He has led by example and by sheer force of character and generosity of spirit, and Shai's efforts have been matched by his colleagues in leadership. We cannot thank you all enough. Let's all look forward to better times together, Covid-19 permitting.\\nCEO Review of 2020\\nThe Covid-19 pandemic presents the biggest crisis since the Second World War, affecting public health, economies and communities globally. Aviation was one of the first industries to be affected and will be one of the last to fully recover. Despite facing the most challenging year in our 36-year history I am proud and humbled to have led Virgin Atlantic's response to the crisis.\\nSince February, we have been guided by the single mission of ensuring Virgin Atlantic's survival, so that we can continue to serve our people, customers and communities for decades to come. It was only achieved through a laser focus on reducing our costs, preserving cash and protecting as many jobs as possible.\\nUndoubtedly the airline has undergone a transformation that no one could have predicted at the beginning of the year and it has come at a huge cost to many of our people, with nearly 1 in 2 jobs lost. But as demand for travel returns, which it will, it's our greatest hope that we will be able to welcome many of our amazing former colleagues back.\\nAs we started 2020, we were on course to return to profitability, a year ahead of plan. This followed a foundational year in 2019, the first year of Velocity; a three-year plan to remove the impediments that prevented customers from flying with us and translating preference for our brand and service into purchase. Returning to profitable growth through an expanded network, improving corporate relevance and continuing to delight our customers with the best in class end to end journey experience, whilst keeping our cost discipline.\\nOur expanded joint venture with Delta and Air France KLM launched in January 2020, creating a $13bn transatlantic partnership of choice for millions of people and businesses. But as events began to unfold, on 1 February, when we took the decision to suspend our flights between London Heathrow and Shanghai, few could have predicted the scale of the global crisis that we would witness.\\nIt is worth highlighting some of the key events in 2020 which have had a lasting impact on our Company.\\nThe first business casualty of the crisis was our investment in Flybe, which entered administration on 5 March, despite the efforts of all involved to turn Europe's largest regional airline around. The impact of Covid-19 on Flybe's trading meant it was unable to secure a viable basis for its continuing operation. As a 30% shareholder in the Connect Airways consortium that acquired Flybe in January 2019, this was a devastating outcome. But with the impact of Covid-19 intensifying on airlines around the world, it was right to focus efforts on ensuring Virgin Atlantic was in the best possible position to weather the storm.\\nOn 16 March the US closed its borders to the UK, already having closed them to Schengen countries. A year later and these restrictions remain. On the same day, the UK Government advised those who could work from home to do so. With the health, safety and security of our people and customers our number one priority, a large proportion of Virgin Atlantic's workforce has operated remotely since 17 March. With our place of work a plane and our unit of time a flight, many of our front- line teams continued to travel into work including our pilots, crew, engineers and those in operational or safety critical roles.\\nOn the 23 March, the UK entered its first national lockdown, and, on the same day, we launched our first cargo only flight, bringing PPE from Shanghai, to support our NHS on the frontline. From 21 April, for a period of 90 days, Virgin Atlantic passenger flights were grounded, and our cargo operations became the primary revenue driver of the airline. The determination and resilience of our teams making this happen provided a much-needed lifeline.\\nOur vision remains to be the most loved travel company and a sustainability leader in our industry but the path to achieve it has changed. On 5 May we announced plans to reshape and resize Virgin Atlantic, including a planned reduction of 3,150 jobs across all functions.\\nWe optimised the network and simplified the fleet through the early retirement of three Airbus A340s and seven Boeing 747s. We consolidated flying at London Heathrow and Manchester, with the ambition to rebuild at Gatwick as demand returns.\\nWe announced plans for the Company to operate under a single brand, with Virgin Holidays becoming Virgin Atlantic Holidays, meaning that for the first time ever, all our revenue generating activities - airline, holidays and cargo - will be consolidated under single leadership to drive a 10x growth mindset when recovery begins.\\nOur actions in 2020 delivered more than \\u00a3300m of cost reductions and reduces our fleet capex by \\u00a3880m over the next five years, culminating in the completion of a privately funded, solvent recapitalisation of the airline on 4 September. Through a court sanctioned Restructuring Plan under the new Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 and with the unanimous support of our shareholders and creditors, we delivered a refinancing package worth \\u00a31.2bn.\\nThis included shareholder support of c.\\u00a3600m over the life of the business plan to 2025, \\u00a3170m of secured financing from Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP and more than \\u00a3450m of support and deferrals from creditors. Again, this came with a devastating impact on our people as we announced a further reduction of 1,150 jobs.\\nDuring Q3 we saw a recovery in passenger flying, with industry leading measures in place for our people and customers through our innovative Fly Safe, Fly Well programme. Despite the amazing advancements in vaccine development, following a rise in Covid-19 cases in the UK, restrictive tiers were introduced in mid-October, followed by a second national lockdown from 5 November.\\nThese were further tightened on 20 December, including a ban on non-essential travel. With tiered restrictions in force for much of the UK in Q4, our teams responded quickly, removing passenger flying and replacing it with cash contributing cargo operations.\\n2020 ended with the realization that recovery would take longer and that Virgin Atlantic, like the rest of the nation, would face further challenges through a tough winter. In December, at the same time many of us faced increased restrictions on our day to day lives, the UK approved the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/ AstraZeneca vaccines. This reignited hope of a turning point in the fight against Covid-19 as we entered 2021.\\nPerformance in 2020. A year like no other\\nWe witnessed dramatic year on year declines in key performance metrics, with revenue and passenger numbers 80% below 2019. ASKs were 73% down on 2019 - driven by the reduction in passenger flying, smaller average fleet gauge and substantial cargo only flying. As a result, sectors did not fall as materially, reducing from 23.5k to 10.6k (or 45% of 2019 levels).\\nAgility in passenger operations. Our passenger flying programme in 2020 was subject to constant change in line with ever changing global travel restrictions. Throughout 2020 we pivoted passenger flying to serve VFR (visiting friends and relatives) and leisure markets, particularly the Caribbean, India and Nigeria.\\nIn December, we launched three new services to Pakistan: London Heathrow to Lahore and Islamabad and Manchester to Islamabad. In November, we announced a new service from London Heathrow to St Vincent, launching in Summer 2021, making Virgin Atlantic the first European carrier to offer direct flights to St Vincent. With a strong heritage in premium leisure, we are well positioned to capitalize on leisure demand as travel at scale returns.\\nRecord year for cargo. Against a volatile outlook for international travel, our cargo team has delivered a record performance. Utilizing our passenger configured Boeing 787s and Airbus A350s, they operated nearly 4,000 cargos only sectors, carried more than 7,000 tonnes of PPE and delivered \\u00a3319m in revenues, a 49% increase on 2019 performance.\\nAlthough overall tonnage declined 32% from 227m in 2019 to 156m tonnes in 2020, contribution increased 148% to \\u00a3261m due to improved yield. With our Pharma Secure product launched in Q4 and our state-of-the-art purpose-built cargo facility at London Heathrow, we expect growth to continue into 2021 and eventually support global distribution of vaccines.\\nVirgin Atlantic Holidays performance mirrored the airline. With UK restrictions on non-essential retail in place for much of 2020, the Virgin Holidays retail estate has remained largely closed since March. In May 2020, 7 of the Vroom stores closed permanently. Having started the year with 55 stores, we ended the year with 50 (36 Next concessions and 14 Vrooms). Revenue declined 85% to \\u00a396m (down from \\u00a3627m), with customer numbers at 58,500, falling 85% on 2019. At a Group level, Virgin Holidays contributed \\u00a318.3m of flight revenue and \\u00a38.7m of hotel and ancillary margin.\\nOur customers. For our customers who did not take to the skies in 2020 due to cancellations caused by Covid-19, it was a challenging period and one where we did not live up to our brand promise. The huge volume of refund requests at the height of the pandemic, combined with constraints on our teams and systems during that period, lengthened our processing times. In 2020, our customer service teams dealt with more than 220,000 requests across our Airline and Holiday businesses and refunded over \\u00a3600m.\\nAccordingly, our customer satisfaction scores as measured by Net Promoter Score (NPS) reflected the measures we put in place, increasing five points on 2019 from 46 to 51. 1 In December, we were awarded 2021 APEX 5* Global airline rating for the fourth year in a row, making us the only British airline to achieved this milestone. Maintaining this rating during the most challenging year in our history is testament to the efforts of our teams on the ground and in the air, to delight our customers every single day. We are especially honoured to have been awarded the Diamond status by APEX Health & Safety powered by SimpliFlying for our comprehensive set of multi-layered measures offering the highest standards of health protection.\\nSurvival, love, profitability\\nAs global economies emerge from Covid-19, Virgin Atlantic has a vital role to play in the UK's economic recovery and a future Global Britain. Supporting vaccine distribution, global supply chains and safely flying our customers to the places they love to travel as soon as they are ready to take to the skies. The only way for Virgin Atlantic to survive 2020, was to resize and reshape so that we can emerge as a sustainably profitable airline from 2022. We went further than most. In 2021, achieving our vision to become the most loved travel company, is anchored on three critical missions: survival, love, profitability.\\nSurvival. Throughout this crisis we have been an industry first mover. The actions taken in 2020 to reduce costs, preserve cash and operate cash positive flying have given us a runway into the summer. With the earliest date for the resumption of international travel at scale now 17 May, we have taken further steps to bolster our cash position. On 15 March 2021 we agreed further financial support from our shareholders and creditors, to the tune of \\u00a3160m and we remain confident in Virgin Atlantic's survival.\\nLove. In 2021, we must get back to our best for our people and customers. Rebuilding trust and confidence in our brand and reassuring our customers to fly safe, fly well.\\nProfitability. The impact of Covid-19 on global aviation will be felt for many years to come, with demand unlikely to return to 2019 levels before 2023. Yet, for Virgin Atlantic, the outlook is transformative. A 10x mindset to revenue growth underpins our commercial plan to regrow revenues to 2019 levels by 2023.\\nPowered by technology transformation, digital first retailing and a right to win in a leisure led recovery. By 2022 we expect to fly more sectors than in 2019 with efficiencies across our fleet, network and non-fuel costs delivering more than \\u00a3200m of recurring fixed cost improvement.\\nIn February 2021 Virgin Red launched a true lifestyle loyalty programme in the UK which, alongside the strength of our transatlantic joint venture with Delta and Air-France KLM, expands our network reach and improves corporate relevance.\\nBecoming most loved\\nOur vision to become the most loved travel company comes with great responsibility and goes beyond providing best in class service to our customers. As an airline we bring huge social and economic benefits to the economies and societies we serve. The need to go further, to serve our people, the planet on which we all live and the communities in which we operate, is unabated by the pandemic.\\nOur people remain our secret sauce and the thing that sets us apart. For our crew and pilots, we have put in place an innovative holding pool structure for 1,780 colleagues. This means that as demand returns and we scale up our flying programme, we are able to welcome back as many of our people as possible. The desire to see them back with us keeps us going.\\nIn 2019, we launched our Passport to Change programme working with local schools in our community to promote studies in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM). In 2020, following events related to the WE Charity in Canada, we mutually agreed to terminate our partnership.\\nIn 2021, we will be relaunching our Passport to Change programme. With over 100 active volunteers at Virgin Atlantic and many more who have registered their interest, we know our people are passionate about improving the opportunities for all our communities.\\nIn 2020, we continued on our path to become a sustainability leader, becoming a signatory of Sustainable Aviation's commitment to Net Zero by 2050. In July we also became a member of the Jet Zero Council, a dynamic partnership between the UK Government and industry focused on developing UK capabilities to deliver net zero emission commercial flying through the acceleration of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting zero emission aircraft R&D.\\nOver the last 14 years, we have transitioned to a cleaner, greener, twin-engined fleet; reducing our CO2/RTK by 18% between 2007-2019. In 2020 we retired the last of our four- engine aircraft and our current, simplified fleet is forecast to be 10% more fuel and carbon efficient per km flown when compared to our fleet profile in 2019. In 2021, we will renew our focus and energy on industry thought leadership and innovation to achieve meaningful change in the years ahead.\\nA big red thank you\\n2020 has been a year like no other and devastating for so many. Without a doubt, it has been the toughest year in Virgin Atlantic's 36-year history. Yet, for all its hardship, 2020 has produced some exceptional moments to be proud of. In many ways we have made the impossible, possible. I have been inspired by amazing people of Virgin Atlantic. By their heroic efforts, extraordinary commitment to our survival, our customers and each other. A special thank you to my leadership team, our partners and shareholders for their unwavering belief, determination, and camaraderie.\\nOur purpose has never been more relevant - everyone can take on the world. We are facing up to the challenge, and as a team we will continue do whatever it takes to ensure our airline keeps proudly flying.\\nCFO Review of 2020\\nOur financial results for 2020 are a stark reflection of the immense challenges that the airline industry has faced from the COVID-19 pandemic. IATA predicts the airline industry to lose $118bn in 2020 with global passenger demand down by 66%. Demand across the transatlantic, which made up 70% of Virgin Atlantic's capacity in 2019, is estimated to have been down by 77%.1\\nThe year had started on plan with January and February in line with targets. From March onwards the pandemic had a dramatic impact on passenger operations. The closure of US borders combined with the UK entering its first lockdown in March led to the temporary cessation of passenger flying from 21 April to 20 July. Q2 ASKs fell to 0.2bn, a drop of 99% on the prior year. Despite passenger flying recommencing in July, ASKs for the second half of 2020 dopped by 87% vs 2019 as demand for international travel remained highly constrained due to travel and border restrictions. Full year passenger revenue fell to \\u00a3446m, 80% lower than the prior year and passenger numbers fell to 1.2m, 80% lower than the prior year.\\nDespite the challenging passenger demand environment our Cargo business thrived and played a vital role in bringing critical medical supplies to the UK. Cargo revenue grew to \\u00a3319m, up 49% on the prior year. Total revenue fell 70% on the prior year to \\u00a3868m.\\nThe scale of revenue reduction and speed at which it occurred forced an immediate shift in priority during February to preserving liquidity. Throughout the year this was achieved through: (1) Disciplined capacity management ensuring only flights contributing positively to cash were flown, (2) Reducing fixed costs and capital expenditure through taking bold and decisive actions to reshape and resize Virgin Atlantic, and (3) Reducing cash burn and raising new capital through the privately funded, solvent recapitalisation of Virgin Atlantic. Together these actions helped reduce overall costs, before exceptional items, by \\u00a31,473m to \\u00a31,382m and raise \\u00a3370m of new financing, drawn in September. The 80% reduction in passengers drove an unprecedented increase in customer refunds with more than \\u00a3600m of refunds processed during the year.\\nOverall, this resulted in an operating loss before exceptional items of \\u00a3514m, \\u00a3586m worse than 2019, and a statutory loss before tax of \\u00a3858m, \\u00a3794m worse than 2019.\\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group's financing consisted of total cash balances of \\u00a3191m (including unrestricted cash of \\u00a3115m) compared to \\u00a3449m at the end of 2019. After the year end and during Q1 2021 further financing has been secured leading to c.\\u00a3200m of additional cash support for the business throughout 2021. This comprises proceeds from a sale & leaseback in January of two Boeing 787s and further support from our largest creditors, underpinned by \\u00a397m of further shareholder support.\\nResizing and reshaping Virgin Atlantic\\nSignificant action was taken throughout 2020 to reduce the cost base and position Virgin Atlantic to become sustainably profitable once passenger demand recovers. Actions reduced operating costs by more than \\u00a3300m and include over \\u00a3200m of recurring fixed cost savings. The key actions taken comprised:\\nConsolidated network: Consolidation of flying at London Heathrow and Manchester while retaining the flexibility to restart Gatwick operations as passenger demand returns. As well as reducing costs this will improve Heathrow slot and aircraft utilisation, improving future profitability.   \\nSimplified fleet: As part of a rationalisation of the fleet we retired all our 4-engined aircraft and brought forward the retirement of an A330-200. This reduced our fleet from 45 to 37 aircraft, through the retirement of 7 Boeing 747-400s and 3 Airbus A340-600s and the arrival of 3 more fuel efficient A350-1000s. Looking forward we will operate one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient long-haul fleets in the sky.   \\nReduced headcount: Over the course of the year, we reduced our total headcount by 41% to 5,907 at year end, while retaining a holding pool structure for nearly 1,800 pilots and crew in preparation for the resumption of significant flying activity anticipated in mid-2021. Headcount reductions were felt across the company with non-customer facing and management headcount reduced by 30%.   \\nOne brand focus: The planned unification of Virgin Holidays under one master brand as Virgin Atlantic Holidays will deliver an aligned brand to customers and enabled efficiencies across marketing and operations; and   \\nCrew productivity: We negotiated ground-breaking agreements with our pilot and crew unions providing the foundation for enhanced operational stability and productivity.   \\nPrivately funded, solvent recapitalisation\\nThe completion of the privately funded, solvent recapitalisation of the airline on 4 September delivered a refinancing package worth \\u00a31.2bn with a further \\u00a3880m reduction to fleet capital expenditure. The key elements comprised:\\nShareholder support of c.\\u00a3600m over 2020-25, including a \\u00a3200m investment from Virgin Group and c.\\u00a3400m of deferred shareholder payments;   \\n\\u00a3170m of secured financing from Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP, a global institutional investment management firm; and   \\nMore than \\u00a3450m of additional deferrals from our largest creditors alongside the support of our credit card acquirers (Merchant Service Providers).   \\nRefunding our customers\\nThe customer refund situation in the early summer was unprecedented, with our customer teams receiving over 10,000 queries per day, and refund requests reaching 10 times the level experienced at any time before the pandemic. Our response was to massively increase the team to over 240 people in 8 countries, as well as offer a market-leading flexibility and incentives programme, which saw over 40% of airline customers choosing to rebook on to future flights. We processed more than \\u00a3600m in cash refunds relating to over 220,000 claims.\\nFinancial results & Key metrics\\n\\u00a3m Revenue\\nEBITDA1 EBIT1 PBTEI2\\nEBIT margin (%)1\\nLoss for the year\\n2019\\n2,927\\n340\\n74\\n(22)\\n3\\n(55)\\nTotal sectors Cargo only sectors ASK (km bn) Passengers (000) Load factor (%)\\nPRASK (p)\\n23,551\\n0\\n48.83\\n5,877\\n81.1\\n4.27\\n10,601\\n3,897\\n13.04\\n1,192\\n61.1\\n3.18\\n868\\n(260)\\n(511)\\n(659)\\n(59)\\n(864)\\n2020\\nPassenger revenue\\nPassenger revenue declined 80% to \\u00a3446m from \\u00a32.2bn in the prior year, driven by passenger numbers falling 80%. The revenue decline followed the temporary cessation of passenger services on 21 April. Passenger services restarted 90 days later on 20 July, and July to October saw gradual month on month growth in passenger flying. The UK lockdown in November and tightening of travel restrictions during December saw passenger flying reduce again. Despite the reduction in passenger demand three new routes were successfully launched in December from London and Manchester to Pakistan.\\nPassenger reductions were seen across the network with UK-US routes down 83% and UK - Non-US routes down 72%. UK- Caribbean routes saw strong demand in the autumn between the periods of UK lockdown however passengers were down 70% for the full year.\\nCargo revenue\\nOur Cargo operations were the standout performer of the year, with revenues up 49% to \\u00a3319m. The revenue performance reflected a significant shortage in capacity within the global air-cargo market. As the no.2 cargo operator from London Heathrow, we were able to service a broad range of customers with scheduled cargo-only flights on key existing routes such as Shanghai, Hong Kong and our US destinations.\\nWe also added new routes including short haul destinations in Norway and Belgium. Our pharmaceutical capabilities were enhanced with the launch of Pharma Secure, a new product designed specifically to cater for the growth in vaccine distribution.\\nUnit price metrics rose on average by 130%, and freight charter flights made up 20% of our cargo operations. Although overall traffic declined 25% on the prior year due to a significant decline in belly capacity on passenger flights, traffic per sector increased significantly to 14 tonnes.\\nVirgin Holidays\\nVirgin Holidays revenue fell 85% to \\u00a396m reflecting the restrictions on non-essential travel present for much of 2020. With Holiday departures declining 80%, holiday distribution, marketing and selling costs were similarly reduced, and the operations were streamlined as part of the single brand unification programme, with Virgin Holidays due to become Virgin Atlantic Holidays. The retail store network was also reduced by 5 stores as part of the restructuring and totalled 50 stores at year end.\\nFuel costs\\nPhysical fuel costs of \\u00a3185m were down \\u00a3502m, reflecting the significant reduction in sectors flown and the retirement of our 4-engined aircraft. Throughout 2020 the operation focused on flying fuel-efficient Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 fleets to minimise fuel costs and maximise cash contribution on cargo and passenger flights.\\nA charge of \\u00a3105m relating to the closing of out-of-the-money fuel price protection hedges, put in place in 2019 to cover expected levels of 2020 flying, was partially offset by foreign exchange and unrealised fair value movements; the net \\u00a381m charge (2019: \\u00a337m credit) was recognised in exceptional items in the income statement, consistent with our usual accounting policies.\\nAircraft costs\\nAircraft and engineering costs together totalled \\u00a3258m, \\u00a391m lower than the prior year. Aircraft costs fell \\u00a315m to \\u00a3158m due to the reduction in the size of our fleet. Engineering and maintenance costs of \\u00a3100m were significantly lower than the prior year, reflecting both reduced flying hours and the retirement of the oldest aircraft in our fleet.\\nOther non-fuel costs\\nNon-fuel, non-aircraft costs of \\u00a3835m, were 54% lower than the prior year. Within this, employee remuneration of \\u00a3277m was \\u00a3145m lower than the prior year, reflecting the in-year savings from our restructuring programme which saw headcount at 31 December of 5,907 compared to 10,016 at the beginning of the year. It also reflects employee participation in the UK Government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) of \\u00a370m. The reduction in other operating and overhead costs of \\u00a3149m vs \\u00a3176m in 2019 reflect the in-year actions on our fixed costs such as indirect staff costs and volume-based reductions in operating costs.\\nFinance costs\\nNet finance costs of \\u00a3148m were \\u00a352m higher than in 2019. This was mainly driven by a \\u00a327m increase in finance lease interest and \\u00a312m increase in interest payable on external debt.\\nResult for the year\\nThe statutory loss after tax for the year was \\u00a3864m, \\u00a3809m less than 2019. EBITDA loss for the year was \\u00a3260m, \\u00a3600m lower than the prior year, and EBIT loss for the year was \\u00a3511m, \\u00a3585m below 2019.\\nThe reported Group loss before tax, equity-accounted investees, exceptional items and fair value movements totalled\\n\\u00a3659m, compared to a \\u00a322m loss in 2019, together with an exceptional charge of \\u00a3189m (2019: \\u00a332m charge). These are made up of \\u00a378m of Covid-related exceptional costs and \\u00a3111m of other exceptional costs. These include \\u00a37.8m relating to the write down of loans made early in the year to Flybe including an offset for post-administration recoveries.\\nBalance sheet, cash flow and financing\\nAdjusted balance sheet metrics\\nCash at the end of the year totaled \\u00a3191m vs \\u00a3449m in 2019, including \\u00a377m (2019: \\u00a397m) of restricted cash, but excluded \\u00a314m of unremitted cash which is recognized within our receivable's balances. The decrease reflected the significant cash outflow resulting from refunds and operating activities of \\u00a3716m, partially offset by new borrowings of \\u00a3591m. Cash from operating activities was an outflow of \\u00a3713m and was driven by the \\u00a3260m EBITDA loss and refunds.\\nNet cash used in investing activities of \\u00a323m reflects the success of the strong cash control measures put in place early in the year, together with the proceeds of the disposal of our Crawley- based facility, The Base. Within the fleet, we acquired an additional A350, while a further 2 A350s joined the fleet under leasing contracts.\\nCash inflow from actions taken in the year totaled \\u00a3456m relating principally to new borrowings of \\u00a3591m from the recapitalization programme described earlier, offset by \\u00a3100m of repayments, principally relating to aircraft leases.\\nMovements within the balance sheet principally reflect the various actions undertaken as part of our solvent recapitalization.\\nShareholder payment deferrals over the period 2020 to 2025 were recognized through a \\u00a3376m preference share issuance and are reflected in the capitalization of intangible assets relating to contracts. The increase in long term payables is also a result of revised repayment terms on contracts with both shareholders and with lessors.\\nLong-term borrowings rose as a result of the recapitalization and deferral of items previously classified as short-term borrowings, including the conversion of the existing RCF to a term loan. Deferred revenue fell, reflecting lower flying activity and reduced future bookings due to the continued uncertainty over Covid restrictions on international travel later in the year. A portion of our long-term borrowings are secured against our UK slot portfolio which had a year-end market value in excess of \\u00a3500m.\\nOutlook\\nWith the recently announced path to exit UK lockdown restrictions, there is a roadmap to recovery and to the recommencement of international passenger flying at scale. Factors such as the emergence of new variants of the Covid-19 virus and the risk of a third wave of infections continue to create significant uncertainties and Virgin Atlantic is not able to provide certainty that there will not be a more severe downside recovery scenario.\\nIn the event that such a scenario was to occur, Virgin Atlantic would need to take further actions and would likely need to secure additional funding beyond what has been achieved to date, however certainty that it will be able to achieve further funding cannot be provided. Please see note 3 'Basis of preparation' for more information.\\nWhile material uncertainties remain as to the timing and shape of recovery, the actions taken in 2020 to reshape and resize Virgin Atlantic have positioned the airline to capitalize on the recovery when it takes hold. The discipline and focus on cost and liquidity management will continue, to help ensure Virgin Atlantic's survival and return to profitability.\\nKey performance indicators\\nThe directors have outlined below the key performance indicators that they rely on to manage the business. These key metrics focus on volume, efficiency and cost performance within our business operations. The financial indicators are stated at constant currency.\\nVirgin Atlantic\\nA key volume measure used to assess volume growth and relative market share. Calculated as the total number of passengers who flew on Virgin Atlantic Aircraft.\\nAn industry standard measure of passenger carrying capacity. Calculated as the number of available seats in each flown sector multiplied by the sector distance in km.\\nAn industry measure of operational efficiency that encompasses both passenger yield and load factor performance. Calculated as the total passenger revenue divided by total ASKs.\\nA key fuel metric, Fuel CASK (p) measures our unit fuel spend and assesses our aircraft fuel efficiency and fuel hedging effectiveness. Calculated as the total fuel spend divided by total ASKs.\\nOur key volume-adjusted operational cost metric that indicates our cost control performance excluding fuel. Calculated as the total operational costs and overheads (ex-financing costs) divided by total ASKs.\\nVirgin Holidays\\nA key measure of volume and activity which drives holiday revenues. Calculated as the total number of customers served in the year, across all holiday types.\\nThis represents the operating margin achieved by the Holiday business from its travel and package holiday operations.\\nCalculated as the profit before tax and exceptional items (PBTEI) contribution.\\nVirgin Atlantic Cargo\\nUtilisation of bellyhold cargo capacity helps drive overall profitability of the airline. Calculated as the revenue generating chargeable weight carried on VA Cargo's network measured in kg\\nUsed to measure revenue performance (\\u00a3) per kilogram carried on VA Cargo's network. It's a measure of pricing execution that has a direct impact on the overall profitability of the business.\\nOur business models\\nVirgin Atlantic Limited comprises three principal lines of business: Virgin Atlantic Airlines, Virgin Atlantic Cargo and Virgin Holidays.\\nVirgin Atlantic Airlines uses a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing aircraft to carry passengers to destinations across North America, the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia from its main bases in London and Manchester, with award winning clubhouses at 7 airports.\\nVirgin Atlantic Cargo trades and retails the belly hold capacity of Virgin Atlantic's cargo-friendly fleet, connecting manufacturers, growers, retailers and consumers across the globe. It has the ability to transport specialist and time-critical cargo ranging from the most temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals and fresh produce to a beloved family pet.\\nVirgin Holidays offers predominantly package holidays to destinations worldwide for customers principally in the UK. It has significant market positions in holidays to major US destinations including Florida and to the Eastern Caribbean. The business offers holidays through online, call centres and retail stores across the UK. Over 90% of Virgin Holidays customers also fly on Virgin Atlantic planes.\\nFor the full report, see:\\nhttps://corporate.virginatlantic.com/content/dam/corporate/Virgin%20Atlantic%20Annual%20Report%202020_final%20v1.pdf\\nVirgin Australia\\nVirgin Australia, the trading name of Virgin Australia Airlines Pty Ltd, is an Australian-based airline. On 21 April 2020, Virgin Australia Holdings went into voluntary administration, due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and financial troubles in the years leading up to the pandemic. On 26 June 2020, it was announced that Bain Capital had entered into a sale and implementation deed with administrator Deloitte to acquire Virgin Australia. Creditors agreed to this proposal on 4 September 2020, with the reorganisation and change of ownership completed on 17 November 2020.\\nCompany Overview\\nIn 2000, the Virgin brand entered the Australian aviation market for the first time, bringing real competition in the leisure sector of the market. Launching the new brand Virgin Australia in May 2011, and the Game Change program announced by CEO John Borghetti, was a key part of repositioning ourselves in the market to be Australia's airline of choice.\\nNow Virgin Australia have a new vision: to revolutionise air travel again, this time across all market segments. We will do this by providing a seamless experience across all international and domestic markets, while retaining the same excellent service.\\nhttps://www.virginaustralia.com/uk/en/about-us/\",\n          \"#(1)\\nThis Week's News\\nEuronews.com - Foxconn and Nvidia team up to build 'AI factories', CEOs say - 18/10/2023\\nTaiwan's electronics manufacturer Foxconn and US chipmaker Nvidia said they will collaborate to build \\\"AI factories\\\" to promote the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\\nFor the complete story, see:\\nhttps://www.euronews.com/next/2023/10/18/foxconn-and-nvidia-team-up-to-build-ai-factories-ceos-say\\nET Telecom - IBM inks 3 pacts with IT Ministry on semiconductor, AI, quantum computing - 18/10/2023\\nIbm: \\\"These are technologies that will shape the future of tech, represents tremendous opportunities for academic, startup and innovation...\\nFor the complete story, see:\\nhttps://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/enterprise-services/ibm-inks-3-pacts-with-it-ministry-on-semiconductor-ai-quantum-computing/104527385\\nKED Global - Samsung Electronics gets favorable ruling against Netlist in US - 18/10/2023\\nThe US appeals court has reversed a California federal judge's ruling against Samsung Electronics Co. in its legal fight over memory chip patents with Netlist Inc., raising expectations that the South Korean memory giant would earn favorable orders in similar legal battles.\\nFor the complete story, see:\\nhttps://www.kedglobal.com/korean-chipmakers/newsView/ked202310180022\\nOther Stories\\nACROFAN - Analog Devices to showcase cutting-edge solutions driving sustainable practices at Industrial Transformation ASIA-PACIFIC 2023 - 18/10/2023\\nSouth China Morning Post - US ban on tailor-made Nvidia and Intel chips hits Beijing's AI ambitions - 18/10/2023\\nDesign And Reuse - Qualcomm to Bring RISC-V Based Wearable Platform to Wear OS by Google - 17/10/2023\\nEE Times Asia - Renesas MCU Enhances Performance of Motor and Power Supply Control Systems - 16/10/2023\\nDigitimes - Micron opens new assembly and test facility in Malaysia - 16/10/2023\\nMedia Releases\\nNVIDIA - NVIDIA Partners With Foxconn to Build Factories and Systems for the AI Industrial Revolution - 17/10/2023\\nQualcomm - Qualcomm to Bring RISC-V Based Wearable Platform to Wear OS by Google - 17/10/2023\\nLatest Research\\nSemiconductor Moir\\u00e9 Materials - By Kin Fai Mak & Jie Shan\\nIndustry Overview\\nGlobal - Semiconductor Industry\\nOverviews of Leading Companies\\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.

As one might expect due to their central importance, the semiconductor industry is extensive and competitive. In 2021,   global semiconductor sales   reached 595 billion U.S. dollars, with the semiconductor industry predicted to grow once again in 2022 to 676 billion U.S. dollars.   Memory semiconductors   and 5G chips led semiconductor market growth in the year.\\nSemiconductor market opportunities\\nSmartphones represent an   important market for the semiconductor industry   , especially as these devices become more advanced and able to support technologies such as   XR   ,   5G   , and   AI   . Servers and data centers will become an even more important opportunity, with semiconductor innovation required to support cloud data centers and the rise in edge computing. Industrial and automotive applications are also expected to experience increased demand: as manufacturing facilities and vehicles become smarter and ever more connected, the requirement for more advanced semiconductor technology to fulfill these tasks grows.\\nSemiconductor companies\\nSome of the   biggest companies within the semiconductor industry   include integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) like Intel, Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology. The South Korean company Samsung held the greatest share of the global semiconductor market, generating more than 73 billion U.S. dollars in   semiconductor revenue   in 2021. The company overtook the previous leader, Intel, benefitting from its dominance in the memory segment of the market. Other notable firms within the global semiconductor industry include   fabless companies   like Qualcomm and Nvidia, the likes of which work closely with foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) -   the world\\\"s largest foundry   - who manufacture chips in their fabrication plants (fabs).\\nSource: statista\\nhttps://www.statista.com/topics/1182/semiconductors/#dossierKeyfigures\\nUS Semiconductor Manufacturing: Industry Trends, Global Competition, Federal Policy\\nIntroduction Semiconductors, tiny electronic devices based on silicon or germanium, provide data processing capabilities in millions of products, from coffee pots to space vehicles. The U.S. government played a significant role in the development of semiconductor technology, and domestic research and production have long been matters of intense congressional interest.\\nU.S.-headquartered semiconductor firms accounted for about half of worldwide semiconductor sales in 2015.1 However, U.S.-headquartered producers face stiff competition from firms headquartered in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan; moreover, the Chinese government has identified global leadership in semiconductors as a national priority. Further, the United States accounts for a diminishing share of global semiconductor production capacity, as manufacturers establish plants in locations where generous subsidies are available or customers in user industries, such as electronic products manufacturing, are nearby. In July 2015, Members of Congress concerned about the industry's competitiveness formed a Semiconductor Caucus to support increased federal funding for semiconductor research activities, among other objectives.\\nSemiconductor Industry Basics\\nA semiconductor chip (also known simply as a \\\"semiconductor\\\" or \\\"chip\\\") is a tiny electronic device (generally smaller than a postage stamp) comprised of billions of components that store, move, and process data. These functions are made possible by the unique properties of semiconducting materials, such as silicon and germanium, which allow for the precise control of the flow of electrical current.\\nSemiconductors are the enabling technology of the information age. Semiconductors allow computers to run software applications, such as email, Internet browsers, and word processing and spreadsheet programs and to store documents, photographs, videos, music, and other data. They also provide the \\\"brains,\\\" memory, and data communication capabilities of countless other products, from cell phones and gaming systems to aircraft and industrial machinery to military equipment and weapons. Even many products with roots in mechanical systems are now heavily dependent on chip-based electronics: one car manufacturer asserts that some of its models incorporate as many as 6,000 semiconductors. And one expert on software in cars estimates that premium-class automobiles can contain close to 100 million lines of software code (instructions) that the chips use to control the vehicle.\\nSource: Congressional Research Service\\nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44544.pdf\\nWorld Semiconductor Trade Statistics\\nThe Chapters of the four world regions appoint 13 directors who form the Board of Directors (supervision). Each region nominates a Vice Chairman who together with the Chairman forms the Executive Commitee (operational steering). The Chairman is elected by the Committee, the assembly of representatives of all member companies. WSTS has two salaried employees, the Administrator and the Assistant to Administrator.\\nThe four regions Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific have regional organizations of WSTS member companies, the so called Chapters . Chapters meet regularly and develop policies and proposals for the operation of WSTS. In addition the Chapters appoint their representatives in the Board of Directors and elect a Vice Chairman , who represents the respective region in the Executive Committee . The Chairman of the Executive Committe however is elected by the Committee, which in turn is composed of one representative of each member company. The tenure of WSTS officers is 18 month. Re-election for a second period is possible. Communication between these various functions happens by correspondence, through this Internet Portal and by meetings.\\nChapters meet two to four times a year, the Board of Directors convenes twice a year (in May and October) and the Executive Committe meets at least twice a year, too. Also the Committee has two meetings per year, normally co-timed and co-located with the venue of the Board of Directors and the Executive Commitee. Obviously the Chapter meetings take place in the respective region, whereas all other meetings with worldwide participation rotate among the regions. The currently established practice is that spring meetings alternate between Japan and Asia Pacific, whereas autumn meetings alternate between Americas and Europe. This scheme provides equitable opportunities for all Committee members to participate.\\nWSTS cooperates closely with the regional Semiconductor Industry Associations. These organizations participate as observers in all major meetings and provide an alternative feedback channel from the semiconductor industry, supplementary to the information that is brought in by the company representatives in the Committee. Semiconductor industry organizations hold also distribution licenses for WSTS reports and thereby provide a commercial distribution channel for these reports to non-semiconductor companies and organizations.\\nAs WSTS collects revenue data from competitors it is mandatory that such data is compiled and consolidated by Data Collection Agents before this data is conveyed to WSTS for the generation of statistic reports. In order to provide best protection to individual member companies' trade data, WSTS uses three Data Collection Agents, one for consolidation of Japanese member companies' data, one for consolidation of Europe member companies' data and another one who consolidates the data of all Asia Pacific and Americas companies. The latter Data Collection Agent also performs the worldwide consolidation of the data from the regions. Data Collection Agents have the typical professional qualification of certified public accountants and are service providers to both the member companies and WSTS in an arm length relationship.\\nThe WSTS employees, the Administrator and the Assistant to Administrator are responsible for the operation of all WSTS programs, for the publication of all reports and any other content of this Internet Portal, for the organization of meetings, for member services and for the financial management of the WSTS.\\nSource: World Semiconductor Trade Statistics\\nhttps://www.wsts.org/ORGANIZATION/GENERAL-PRINCIPLES\\nIntroduction to Semiconductors\\nEssence of a semiconductor\\nA semiconductor can be considered a material having a conductivity ranging between that of an insulator and a metal. A crucial property of semiconductors is the   band gap   ; a range of forbidden energies within the electronic structure of the material. Semiconductors typically have bandgaps ranging between 1 and 4 eV, whilst insulators have larger bandgaps, often greater than 5 eV [1]. The thermal energy available at room temperature, 300 K, is approximately 25 meV and is thus considerably smaller than the energy required to promote an electron across the bandgap. This means that there are a small number of carriers present at room temperature, due to the high energy tail of the Boltzmann-like thermal energy distribution. It is the ability to control the number of charge carriers that makes semiconductors of great technological importance.\\nSemiconducting materials are very sensitive to impurities in the crystal lattice as these can have a dramatic effect on the number of mobile charge carriers present. The controlled addition of these impurities is known as doping and allows the tuning of the electronic properties, an important requirement for technological applications. The properties of a pure semiconductor are called 'intrinsic', whilst those resulting from the introduction of dopants are called 'extrinsic'. This introduction of dopants results in the creation of new, intra-band, energy levels and the generation of either negative (electrons) or positive (holes) charge carriers. More detail on doping can be found on the   electronic bandstructure   webpage.\\nCrystal structure\\nClicking on a title will reveal the relevant images for that crystal structure. More information on crystallography can be found on   this page   .\\nCubic Structures\\nCubic structures have the simple property that their unit cells take the shape of a cube. There are three main variants of the cubic crystal system: the simple cubic, the bodycentered cubic (BCC) and the face-centred cubic (FCC) structures. Of greatest interest is the face-centred cubic, as several derivatives of this structure are found amongst semiconducting materials.\\nFCC structure\\nThe FCC lattice features an atom at the corners of the unit cell, in addition to one at the centre of each face. This structure is often adopted by metals as it maximises their co-ordination number.\\nDiamond structure\\nThe strong covalent bonds that carbon forms with itself result in the tetrahedrally-bonded diamond structure. Each diamond atom is bonded to four neighbours and has a co-ordination number of 8. Diamond is the prototype material, however, other Group IV elements (Si, Ge and Sn) also have this structure.\\nZincblende structure\\nAs with silicon and germanium, the III-V compound semiconductors form bonds with covalent characteristics. This results in a struture very similar to that of diamond, however, in diamond each carbon atom is bonded to another carbon atom. In the zincblende structure each atom is bonded to a different species of atom and results in a mixed lattice. The zincblende structure consists of two interpenetrating FCC lattices, where one lattice is offset by 1/4 of the unit cell. One type of atom occupies one set of lattice positions and the other species the second lattce.\\nA large number of III-V compound semiconductors adopt this structure, including AlAs, GaAs, GaP, InP and ZnSe.\\nHexagonal Structures\\nHexagonal structures have the property that they have hexagonal symmetry, with the unit cell assuming the shape of a rhombus.\\nWurtzite structure\\nMany III-V compound semiconductors can also be grown in a strucural phase known as wurtzite and is the hexagonal analogue to the zincblende structure.\\nSource:  Warwick.\\nhttps://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/current/postgraduate/regs/mpagswarwick/ex5/intro/\\nLeading Companies\\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc.

Our third quarter fiscal 2023 outlook is based on current expectations and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this release. These statements supersede all prior statements regarding our business outlook set forth in prior ADI news releases, and ADI disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. The adjusted results and adjusted anticipated results above are financial measures presented on a nonGAAP basis.

In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These non-GAAP measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company's use of non GAAP measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release. Management uses non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the Company's operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-GAAP measures also assist management in evaluating the Company's core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company's earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company's core business. Management also believes that the non-GAAP liquidity measure free cash flow is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities. The non-GAAP financial measures referenced by ADI in this release include: adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin percentage, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating expenses percentage, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted nonoperating expense (income), adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), free cash flow, and free cash flow revenue percentage. Adjusted gross margin is defined as gross margin, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding certain acquisition related expenses1, which are described further below. Adjusted gross margin percentage represents adjusted gross margin divided by revenue. Adjusted operating expenses is defined as operating expenses, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below. Adjusted operating expenses percentage represents adjusted operating expenses divided by revenue. Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below. Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by revenue. Adjusted nonoperating expense (income) is defined as nonoperating expense (income), determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: certain acquisition related expenses1, which is described further below. Adjusted income before income taxes is defined as income before income taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, and special charges, net3, which are described further below. Adjusted provision for income taxes is defined as provision for income taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding tax related items4, which are described further below. Adjusted tax rate represents adjusted provision for income taxes divided by adjusted income before income taxes. Adjusted diluted EPS is defined as diluted EPS, determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding: acquisition related expenses1, acquisition related transaction costs2, special charges, net3, and tax related items4, which are described further below. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, less additions to property, plant and equipment, net.

Applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors' ability to review the company's business from the same perspective as the company's management, and facilitate comparisons of this period's results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of Applied's ongoing operating performance. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\nForward-Looking Statements\\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements, including those regarding anticipated growth and trends in our businesses and markets, industry outlooks and demand drivers, technology transitions, our business and financial performance and market share positions, our capital allocation and cash deployment strategies, our investment and growth strategies, our development of new products and technologies, our business outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and beyond, and other statements that are not historical facts.

These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about MACOM's strategic plans, priorities and long-term growth drivers, our ability to execute our long-term strategy, improve our position and drive market share gains, our ability to better address certain markets, expand our capabilities and extend our product offerings through the acquisition of Linearizer Communications Group (\\\"Linearizer Acquisition\\\"), statements about the potential market and product expansion opportunities resulting from MACOM's establishment of its European Semiconductor Center (\\\"ESC\\\"), the team's capabilities and technology and expansion thereof and any potential financial benefits derived by and financial impact to MACOM from the Linearizer Acquisition or the OMMIC SAS asset acquisition and ESC establishment, strength and competitiveness of new product introductions and technology portfolio expansion, anticipated demand for our products, MACOM's profitability, revenue targets, prospects and growth opportunities in our three primary markets, the potential impact to our business of an economic downturn or recession, anticipated financial and business improvements, the estimated financial results for our 2023 fiscal fourth quarter and the stated business outlook and future results of operations for the remainder of fiscal year 2023.\\nThese forward-looking statements reflect MACOM's current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause those events or our actual activities or results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including any failure to accurately anticipate demand for our products and effectively manage our inventory; risks related to any weakening of economic conditions; our dependence on a limited number of customers; our ability to develop new products and achieve market acceptance of those products; component shortages or other disruptions in our supply chain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical unrest or otherwise; inflationary pressures; our ability to compete effectively; and those other factors described in \\\"Risk Factors\\\" in MACOM's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\\\"SEC\\\"), including its Annual Report on Form 10-K, its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and MACOM undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\\nDiscussion Regarding the Use of Historical and Forward-Looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nIn addition to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\\\"GAAP\\\") reporting, MACOM provides investors with financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP, such as: non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations and operating margin, non-GAAP EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP income tax rate and non-GAAP interest (income) expense. In this release or elsewhere, we may alternatively refer to such non-GAAP measures as \\\"adjusted\\\" measures. This non-GAAP information excludes the effect, where applicable, of intangible amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, non-cash interest, acquisition and integration related costs, equity method investment gains and losses and the tax effect of each non-GAAP adjustment.\\nManagement believes these excluded items are not reflective of our underlying performance and uses these non-GAAP financial measures to: evaluate our ongoing operating performance and compare it against prior periods, make operating decisions, forecast future periods, evaluate potential acquisitions, compare our operating performance against peer companies and assess certain compensation programs. We believe this non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into our ongoing performance and have therefore chosen to provide this information to investors to help them evaluate the results of our ongoing operations and enable more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\nA reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. We have not provided a reconciliation with respect to any forward-looking non-GAAP financial data presented because we do not have and cannot reliably estimate certain key inputs required to calculate the most comparable GAAP financial data, such as future acquisition costs, the possibility and impact of any litigation costs, changes in our GAAP effective tax rate and impairment charges. We believe these unknown inputs are likely to have a significant impact on any estimate of the comparable GAAP financial data.\\nInvestors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, non-GAAP financial measures may have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies because different companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures in different ways because non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\\nhttps://ir.macom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/macom-reports-fiscal-third-quarter-2023-financial-results\\nAtmel Corporation\\nMicrochip Technology Inc. is a leading provider of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions.

The midpoint of our guidance provided on May 4, 2023 was net sales of $2.289 billion.   \\nOn a GAAP basis: record gross profit of 68.1%; record operating income of $903.1 million and a record 39.5% of net sales; record net income of $666.4 million; and record EPS of $1.21 per diluted share. Our guidance provided on May 4, 2023 was for GAAP EPS of $1.15 to $1.16 per diluted share.   \\nOn a Non-GAAP basis: record gross profit of 68.4%; record operating income of $1.100 billion and a record 48.1% of net sales; net income of $905.3 million and record EPS of $1.64 per diluted share. Our guidance provided on May 4, 2023 was for Non-GAAP EPS of $1.63 to $1.65 per diluted share.   \\nPaid down $413.0 million of debt in the June 2023quarter. Cumulatively paid down $6.8 billion of debt over the last 20 quarters. Reduced net leverage to 1.29x.   \\nReturned approximately $349.2 million to shareholders in the June quarter through dividends of $208.9 million and the repurchase of approximately $140.3 million, or 1.8 million shares of our common stock, at an average price of $77.51 per share under our previously announced $4.0 billion stock buyback program. Cumulatively repurchased approximately $1.512 billion, or 20.3 million shares, over the last seven quarters.   \\nRecord quarterly dividend declared today for the September quarter of 41.0 cents per share, an increase of 36.2% from the year ago quarter.   \\nNet sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were a record $2.289 billion, up 16.6% from net sales of $1.964 billion in the prior year's first fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $666.4 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, up from GAAP net income of $507.2 million, or $0.90per diluted share, in the prior year's firstfiscal quarter. For the firstquarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, GAAP net income was adversely impacted by amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with our previous acquisitions. Non-GAAP net income for the firstquarter of fiscal 2024was a record at $905.3 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, up from non-GAAP net income of $767.2 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, in the prior year's first fiscal quarter. For the first quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our non-GAAP results exclude the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, and losses on the settlement of debt. For the firstquarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our non-GAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release. Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 41.0 cents per share, up 36.2% from the year ago quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on September 5, 2023 to stockholders of record on August 22, 2023. \\\"Our June quarter results were in-line with the midpoint of our guidance as revenue grew 2.5% sequentially and 16.6% year over year, amid a weakening macro backdrop and increased business uncertainty,\\\" said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. \\\"We delivered record revenue of $2.29 billion during our first fiscal quarter, marking the 11th consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Our team's disciplined execution, in combination with resilient end markets and a diverse customer base, helped to drive record non-GAAP gross and operating margins of 68.4% and 48.1%, respectively.\\\" Mr. Moorthy added, \\\"We continue to navigate a challenging market environment and are trending toward supply chain normalization as we continue to improve lead times for many of our products. In the June quarter, we further assisted customers in de-risking their inventory positions by pushing out non-reschedulable backlog to future quarters. China was our weakest region again, as macro softness drove weaker sell-through activity and inventory build at Chinese distributors. Even as our broad base of customers experience demand uncertainty, we expect our operating metrics to demonstrate resiliency through this business cycle.\\\"\\nEric Bjornholt, Microchip's Chief Financial Officer, said, \\\"We continued to pay down our debt with another $413.0 million of payments during the June quarter, reflecting a cumulative debt pay down of over $6.8 billion over the past 20 quarters, as we have enhanced our operating performance while actively managing the working capital requirements for the business. We ended the June 2023 quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 1.29x compared to 2.05x at the end of the June 2022 quarter. Our operating model has been, and remains, a strong cash generator and continues to demonstrate consistently high non-GAAP operating margins as we execute our Microchip 3.0 strategy.\\\" Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Executive Chair, said, \\\"Microchip's board of directors approved a record dividend of 41 cents per share, which represents a 36.2% year-over-year increase. Given our cash flow generation during the June quarter, we are targeting to return $562.6 millionto our shareholders in the September quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Our board remains committed to increasing cash returns to shareholders with the goal of returning 100% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders by the March 2025 quarter.\\\" Mr. Moorthy concluded, \\\"Considering the macro environment we face of slowing economic activity and increasing business uncertainty, combined with the active steps we are taking to help customers with inventory positions to push out some of their backlog, we expect net sales in the September quarter to be up 1% to down 3% sequentially. At the mid-point of our guidance for the September quarter, net sales would be 9.3% higher than the year-ago quarter. Notwithstanding any nearterm macro weakness, we are confident that semiconductors remain the engine of innovation for the applications and markets we serve. Our focus on Total System Solutions and key market megatrends is fueling strong design-win momentum that we expect will drive above-market long-term growth.\\\"\\nMicrochip's Highlights for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2023:\\nPublished annual Sustainability Report, highlighting key sustainability goals, the strategies used to implement them, and progress made to further sustainable business practices.   \\nAnnounced the promotion of Rich Simoncic to executive vice president. Rich will continue to manage all of Microchip's analog business units while playing a larger role assisting the CEO with corporate initiatives such as strategic planning, total system solutions, market megatrends and investor relations.   \\nReleased updated, next-generation MPLAB\\u00ae ICD 5 and MPLAB PICkit\\u2122 5 in-circuit debuggers/programmers with advanced connectivity and power options for developers of designs based on PIC\\u00ae, AVR\\u00ae and SAM devices and dsPIC\\u00ae Digital Signal Controllers (DSCs).

The new tools are designed to help customers slash time to innovation by making it easier to than ever to switch to PolarFire\\u00ae FPGAs and System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGAs.   \\nSecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook:\\nCapital expenditures for the quarter ending September 30, 2023 are expected to be between $90 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2024 are expected to be between $300 million and $400 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing capabilities to support the expected growth of our business.\\nUnder the GAAP revenue recognition standard, which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires.\\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: Our non-GAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of share-based compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities (including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition), professional services associated with certain legal matters, and losses on the settlement of debt. For the first quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, our nonGAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of share-based compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Share-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other non-GAAP adjustments are either non-cash expenses, unusual or infrequent items, or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models. We are using non-GAAP operating expenses in dollars, including non-GAAP research and development expenses and nonGAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP other expense, net, and non-GAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance.\\nManagement believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this non-GAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non-cash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our non-GAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these non-GAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these non-GAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP results. Generally, gross profit fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue; variances in manufacturing yields; fixed cost absorption; wafer fab loading levels; costs of wafers from foundries; inventory reserves; pricing pressures in our non-proprietary product lines; and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels. Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures (additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading \\\"Supplemental Financial Information\\\"), and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the September 2023 quarter between $85 and $95 per share (however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what ourstock option exercise activity will be during the quarter).\\nhttps://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/investor/press-release/MCHP_Announces_Record_Q1FY24_Financial_Results.080323.pdf\\nBroadcom Corporation\\nBroadcom Inc.

(Nasdaq: AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, today reported financial results for its second quarter of fiscal year 2023, ended April 30, 2023, provided guidance for the third quarter of its fiscal year 2023 and announced its quarterly dividend.\\n\\\"Broadcom's second quarter results were driven by demand for next generation technologies from hyperscale, while enterprise and service providers continued to sustain,\\\" said Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom Inc. \\\"Our third quarter outlook projects year-over-year growth, reflecting continued leadership in networking as we support a measured ramp into large scale AI networks.\\\"\\n\\\"Consolidated revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $8.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin increased year-over-year to 65%,\\\" said Kirsten Spears, CFO of Broadcom Inc. \\\"We generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow, and expect cash flows to remain strong for Q3.\\\"\\nSecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Highlights\\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal quarter were $11,553 million, compared to $12,647 million at the end of the prior quarter.\\nDuring the second fiscal quarter, the Company generated $4,502 million in cash from operations and spent $122 million on capital expenditures. The Company spent $3,420 million on share repurchases and eliminations, consisting of $2,806 million in repurchases of 4.6 million shares and $614 million of withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards that vested in the quarter (representing approximately 1.0 million shares withheld).\\nOn March 31, 2023, the Company paid a cash dividend of $4.60 per share, totaling $1,914 million.\\nThe differences between the Company's GAAP and non-GAAP results are described generally under \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" below, and presented in detail in the financial reconciliation tables attached to this release.\\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Business Outlook\\nBased on current business trends and conditions, the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, ending July 30, 2023, is expected to be as follows:\\nThird quarter revenue guidance of approximately $8.85 billion; and   \\nThird quarter Adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately 65 percent of projected revenue.   \\nThe guidance provided above is only an estimate of what the Company believes is realizable as of the date of this release.

The Company undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise any of these projections, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\\nQuarterly Dividends\\nThe Company's Board of Directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $4.60 per share. The dividend is payable on June 30, 2023 to stockholders of record at the close of business (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time) on June 22, 2023.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nThe non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. Broadcom believes non-GAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Company's on-going performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Company's on-going operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons.\\nIn addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information excludes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, litigation settlements, loss on debt extinguishment, gains (losses) on investments, income (loss) from discontinued operations, non-GAAP tax reconciling adjustments, and other adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Company's underlying performance. Internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Company's operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Company's competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcom's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.\\nFree cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcom's free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.\\nAbout Broadcom Inc.\\nBroadcom Inc.

This change is intended to drive a more effective go-to-market capability and to accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a result, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other business reorganizations. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the company internally receives information and manages and monitors operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2023.\\nBusiness Highlights\\nIntel remains on track to meet its goal of achieving five nodes in four years and to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. The company announced an industry-first implementation of backside power using Intel PowerVia in a test chip, resulting in notable performance and efficiency gains. PowerVia will be incorporated into Intel 20A, expected to launch in the first half of 2024.   \\nIFS announced that Boeing and Northrop Grumman have committed to joining the U.S. Department of Defense's RAMP-C program, led by Intel. The program is intended to assure domestic access to next-generation semiconductors by establishing and demonstrating a U.S.-based foundry ecosystem to develop and fabricate chips on Intel 18A.   \\nDCAI announced the general availability of cloud instances of its 4th Gen Intel\\u00ae Xeon\\u00ae Scalable processors by Google Cloud.

This follows Intel's recent collaboration with Boston Consulting Group to deliver enterprise-grade, secure generative AI to customers leveraging Intel's Gaudi\\u00ae and 4th Gen Xeon offerings.   \\nIn CCG, Intel continued to see strong demand for its 13th Gen Intel\\u00ae Core\\u2122 processor family, with more than 300 designs expected from OEM partners this year. It also announced a collaboration with Microsoft to drive the development of AI on personal computing, and previewed AI-enabled capabilities of Intel's upcoming Meteor Lake client PC processors at Microsoft's Build 2023 conference. In addition, Intel introduced the Intel\\u00ae Arc\\u2122 Pro A60 and Pro A60M as new members of the Intel Arc Pro A-series professional range of graphics processing units (GPUs).   \\nFor NEX, Intel, Ericsson and HPE successfully demonstrated the industry's first vRAN solution running on the 4th Gen Intel\\u00ae Xeon\\u00ae Scalable processor with Intel\\u00ae vRAN Boost. Intel also recently completed an agreement with Ericsson to partner broadly on its next-generation optimized 5G infrastructure, under which Ericsson will utilize Intel's 18A process technology for its future custom 5G SoC. In addition, Intel and Ericsson will expand the collaboration announced at Mobile World Congress 2023 to accelerate industry-scale open RAN utilizing standard Intel Xeon-based platforms as telcos transform to a foundation of programmable, software-defined infrastructure.   \\nMobileye continued to generate strong profitability in the second quarter and demonstrated traction with its advanced product portfolio by announcing a SuperVision eyes-on, hands-off design win with Porsche and a mobility-as-a-service collaboration with Volkswagen Group that will soon begin testing.   \\nIntel continues to strategically invest in manufacturing capacity to further advance IDM 2.0, and during the quarter announced the selection of Wroc\\u0142aw, Poland, as the site of a new cutting-edge semiconductor assembly and test facility. This facility, in which Intel expects to invest as much as $4.6 billion, will help meet critical demand for assembly and test capacity that Intel anticipates by 2027. Additionally, Intel and the German federal government signed a revised letter of intent for Intel's planned leading-edge wafer fabrication site in Magdeburg, Germany. The agreement encompasses Intel's expanded investment in the site, now expected to be more than 30 billion euros for two first-of-a-kind semiconductor facilities in Europe, along with increased government support that includes incentives. Together, these investments represent a major step toward a balanced and resilient supply chain for Europe.\\nIntel also agreed to sell an approximately 20% stake in its IMS Nanofabrication GmbH business to Bain Capital Special Situations in a transaction that values IMS at approximately $4.3 billion. This investment will position IMS to capture the significant market opportunity for multi-beam mask writing tools, which are critical to the semiconductor ecosystem for enabling EUV (extreme ultraviolet lithography) technology, by accelerating innovation and enabling deeper cross-industry collaboration.\\nQ3 2023 Dividend\\nThe company announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on the company's common stock, which will be payable on Sept. 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of Aug. 7, 2023.\\nBusiness Outlook\\nIntel's guidance for the third quarter of 2023 includes both GAAP and non-GAAP estimates. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are included below.*\\nActual results may differ materially from Intel's Business Outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors described under \\\"Forward-Looking Statements\\\" below.\\n*Effective January 2023, Intel increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from five years to eight years.

The company's pioneering work in accelerated computing and AI is reshaping trillion-dollar industries, such as transportation, healthcare and manufacturing, and fueling the growth of many others.\\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/\\nNVIDIA - NVIDIA Announces Preliminary Financial Results for Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 - 8/8/2022\\nPreliminary second quarter revenue of $6.70 billion versus outlook of $8.10 billion   \\nShortfall versus outlook primarily driven by weaker Gaming revenue   \\nManagement to discuss financial results and outlook on Aug. 24 earnings call   \\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) today announced selected preliminary financial results for the second quarter ended July 31, 2022.\\nSecond quarter revenue is expected to be approximately $6.70 billion, down 19% sequentially and up 3% from the prior year, primarily reflecting weaker than forecasted Gaming revenue. Gaming revenue was $2.04 billion, down 44% sequentially and down 33% from the prior year. Data Center revenue was $3.81 billion, up 1% sequentially and up 61% from the prior year.\\nThe shortfall relative to the May revenue outlook of $8.10 billion was primarily attributable to lower sell-in of Gaming products reflecting a reduction in channel partner sales likely due to macroeconomic headwinds. In addition to reducing sell-in, the company implemented pricing programs with channel partners to reflect challenging market conditions that are expected to persist into the third quarter.\\nData Center revenue, though a record, was somewhat short of the company's expectations, as it was impacted by supply chain disruptions.\\nSecond quarter results are expected to include approximately $1.32 billion of charges, primarily for inventory and related reserves, based on revised expectations of future demand.\\n\\\"Our gaming product sell-through projections declined significantly as the quarter progressed,\\\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \\\"As we expect the macroeconomic conditions affecting sell-through to continue, we took actions with our Gaming partners to adjust channel prices and inventory.\\n\\\"NVIDIA has excellent products and position driving large and growing markets. As we navigate these challenges, we remain focused on the once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvent computing for the era of AI,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"The significant charges incurred in the quarter reflect previous long-term purchase commitments we made during a time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty,\\\" said Colette Kress, EVP and CFO of NVIDIA.\\n\\\"We believe our long-term gross margin profile is intact. We have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term growth while managing near-term profitability. We plan to continue stock buybacks as we foresee strong cash generation and future growth,\\\" she said.\\n1  Announced in May 2022 in connection with the company's press release announcing its financial results for first quarter fiscal 2023.\\nThe preliminary results for the second quarter ended July 31, 2022, are an estimate, based on information available to management as of the date of this release, and are subject to further changes upon completion of the company's standard quarter and year-end closing procedures. This update does not present all necessary information for an understanding of NVIDIA's financial condition as of the date of this release, or its results of operations for the second quarter. As NVIDIA completes its quarter-end financial close process and finalizes its financial statements for the quarter, it will be required to make significant judgments in a number of areas. It is possible that NVIDIA may identify items that require it to make adjustments to the preliminary financial information set forth above and those changes could be material. NVIDIA does not intend to update such financial information prior to release of its final second quarter financial statement information, which is currently scheduled for Aug. 24, 2022.\\nNon-GAAP Measures\\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, this press release includes preliminary estimates of non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These preliminary estimates of non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, and income tax expense.\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, gains or losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount and the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable.\\nA preliminary updated reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses and tax rate is as follows:\\nNVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user's overall understanding of the company's financial performance. The presentation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company's non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\\nhttps://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-preliminary-financial-resultsfor-second-quarter-fiscal-2023\\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.\\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.

The impact of the reclassification on DPO (decreasing impact) and CCC (increasing impact) was 17 days for the second quarter of 2022.   \\nGross financial leverage is defined as gross debt divided by trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA.   \\nNet financial leverage is defined as net debt divided by trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA.   \\nWeighted average number of diluted shares for the three-month period ended July 2, 2023 was 261.3 million.   \\nGuidance for the Third Quarter 2023: ($ millions, except Per Share data)  (1)\\nNote (1) Additional Information:\\nGAAP Gross Profit is expected to include Purchase Price Accounting (\\\"PPA\\\") effects, $(13) million; Share-based Compensation, $(13) million; Other Incidentals, $(23) million;   \\nGAAP Operating Income (loss) is expected to include PPA effects, $(86) million; Share-based Compensation, $(102) million; Restructuring and Other Incidentals, $(26) million;   \\nGAAP Financial Income (expense) is expected to include Other financial expense $(3) million;   \\nGAAP Non-Controlling Interest (NCI) and Other includes non-controlling interest $(4) million and Other $(1) million;   \\nGAAP diluted EPS is expected to include the adjustments noted above for PPA effects, Share-based Compensation, Restructuring and Other Incidentals in GAAP Operating Income (loss), the adjustment for Other financial expense, the adjustment for Non-controlling interest & Other and the adjustment on Tax due to the earlier mentioned adjustments.   \\nNXP has based the guidance included in this release on judgments and estimates that management believes are reasonable given its assessment of historical trends and other information reasonably available as of the date of this release. Please note, the guidance included in this release consists of predictions only, and is subject to a wide range of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond NXP's control. The guidance included in this release should not be regarded as representations by NXP that the estimated results will be achieved. Actual results may vary materially from the guidance we provide today. In relation to the use of non-GAAP financial information see the note regarding \\\"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" below. For the factors, risks, and uncertainties to which judgments, estimates and forward-looking statements generally are subject see the note regarding \\\"Forward-looking Statements.\\\" We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, including the guidance set forth herein, to reflect future events or circumstances.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nIn managing NXP's business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures, that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\\\"GAAP\\\"). In measuring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing our gross margin and operating margin and when assessing appropriate levels of research and development efforts. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting NXP's business. We believe that they enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain non-cash expenses and share-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in NXP's underlying performance. This information also enables investors to compare financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management.\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of these and other similar items in NXP's non-GAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial statements portion of this release in a schedule entitled \\\"Financial Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Results (unaudited).\\\" Please refer to the NXP Historic Financial Model file found on the Financial Information page of the Investor Relations section of our website at   https://investors.nxp.com   for additional information related to our rationale for using these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as the impact of these measures on the presentation of NXP's operations.\\nIn addition to providing financial information on a basis consistent with GAAP, NXP also provides the following selected financial measures on a non-GAAP basis: (i) Gross profit, (ii) Gross margin, (iii) Research and development, (iv) Selling, general and administrative, (v) Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, (vi) Other income, (vii) Operating income (loss), (viii) Operating margin, (ix) Financial Income (expense), (x) Income tax benefit (provision), (xi) Results relating to equity-accounted investees, (xii) Net income (loss) attributable to stockholders, (xiii) Earnings per Share - Diluted, (xiv) EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, and (xv) free cash flow, trailing 12 month free cash flow and trailing 12 month free cash flow as a percent of Revenue. The non-GAAP information excludes, where applicable, the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, the purchase accounting effect on inventory and property, plant and equipment, merger related costs (including integration costs), certain items related to divestitures, share-based compensation expense, restructuring and asset impairment charges, extinguishment of debt, foreign exchange gains and losses, income tax effect on adjustments described above and results from equity-accounted investments.\\nThe difference in the benefit (provision) for income taxes between our GAAP and non-GAAP results relates to the income tax effects of the GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments that we make and the income tax effect of any discrete items that occur in the interim period. Discrete items primarily relate to unexpected tax events that may occur as these amounts cannot be forecasted (e.g., the impact of changes in tax law and/or rates, changes in estimates or resolved tax audits relating to prior year tax provisions, the excess or deficit tax effects on share-based compensation, etc.).\\nAbout NXP Semiconductors\\nNXP Semiconductors N.V.

Operating profit rose sequentially to KRW 0.67 trillion as the DS Division posted a narrower loss, while Samsung Display Corporation (SDC) and the Digital Appliances Business saw improved profitability.\\nThe Memory Business saw results improve from the previous quarter as its focus on High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and DDR5 products in anticipation of robust demand for AI applications led to higher-than-guided DRAM shipments. System semiconductors posted a decline in profit due to lower utilization rates on weak demand from major applications.\\nIn the mobile panel business, earnings were similar to the previous quarter on the back of solid sales of premium panels, while the large panel business continued to focus on QD-OLEDs in the premium market.\\nThe Device eXperience (DX) Division achieved strong profitability due to higher sales of premium TVs and digital appliances, an improved cost structure and increased operational efficiency. The Networks Business's revenue declined in major overseas markets including North America and Japan.\\nHarman posted revenue and profit growth, led by demand for consumer audio such as portable and True Wireless Stereo products. Harman also won the largest automotive order in its history in the quarter.\\nThe weakness of the Korean won against the US dollar, euro and major emerging currencies resulted in a positive impact on company-wide operating profit.\\nGlobal demand is expected to gradually recover in the second half of the year which should lead to an improvement in earnings driven by the component business. However, continued macroeconomic risks could prove to be a challenge in such recovery in demand.\\nThe DS Division will focus on sales of high-value-added products such as DDR5, LPDDR5x and HBM amid expectations of a recovery in demand. It will continue to strengthen mid- to long-term competitiveness by increasing investments in infrastructure, R&D and packaging technology, while also enhancing the completeness of the Gate-All-Around (GAA) process.\\nSDC's mobile panel business is expected to post improved earnings as major customers launch new smartphone models, while the large panel business will address year-end seasonal demand with a supply of ultra-large panels.\\nThe DX Division plans to sustain solid profitability with new foldable smartphone and wearable launches and by increasing sales of premium TVs and digital appliances. The Networks Business aims to win new projects to grow revenue and reinforce technology leadership in 5G core chips and software-based virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRAN).\\nThe Digital Appliances Business plans to expand the Bespoke lineup globally and increase sales of energy-efficient products featuring the Energy Savings Mode on SmartThings, while Harman is expected to improve profitability with higher sales of consumer audio products.\\nThe Company's total capital expenditures in the second quarter stood at KRW 14.5 trillion, including KRW 13.5 trillion for semiconductors and KRW 0.6 trillion for displays. Spending on memory was concentrated on completing the P3 infrastructure and the P4 framework for mid- to long-term supply. Foundry investments continued to focus on fabs in Taylor, Texas and Pyeongtaek, Korea to address the demand for advanced nodes, while investments in displays focused on infrastructure and module production enhancements.\\nMemory Business To See Improved Growth amid Stabilizing Market\\nThe DS Division posted KRW 14.73 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 4.36 trillion in operating losses for the second quarter.\\nThe Memory Business achieved its bit growth guidance even as it saw more limited price drops for both DRAM and NAND, which ultimately contributed to a quarter-on-quarter improvement in performance. As server customers continued inventory adjustment, overall purchase demand had not yet recovered. Due to the strong demand for generative AI, however, investment from the data center sector was concentrated on AI servers.\\nFor DRAM, the Memory Business exceeded bit growth guidance by expanding sales on applications of consumer, graphics and automotive in addition to expanding sales focusing on servers, especially by actively responding to rising demand for DDR5 and HBM for generative AI applications.\\nAs for NAND, the Memory Business actively responded to the demand for flagship smartphones with competitiveness in UFS 4.0 and also achieved bit growth guidance by increasing sales of gaming devices, branded products for retail and so on. Meanwhile, the price decline was considerably less than the previous quarter.\\nLooking to the second half of the year, the market is expected to gradually move toward stability considering increasing production cuts in the industry, while inventory adjustments by customers are likely to wind down.\\nIn mobile and PC applications, with the normalization of major customers' set inventory levels, Set-Build demand is expected to improve due to the launch of new smartphones and PC promotion in the second half of the year.\\nThe server demand is expected to recover gradually and, in terms of products, demand for DDR4 and DDR5 is also expected to improve.\\nBased on supply flexibility linked to market conditions, the Memory Business will optimize its portfolio by focusing on high value-added and high-density products. In DRAM, to strengthen leadership in high-performance servers and mobile high-end segments, the Memory Business will rapidly increase the share of leading-edge products such as DDR5, LPDDR5x and HBM.\\nIn the second quarter, the System LSI Business posted a lower-than-expected improvement in its earnings due to the delayed recovery of demand for semiconductors and customers' continued inventory adjustments.\\nHowever, the System LSI Business won a design award for automotive SoCs with a domestic OEM for their 2025 premium model, and it also continued efforts to expand SoC applications including actively discussing mid- to long-term cooperation with European customers.\\nThe System LSI Business expanded its applications to fingerprint authentication cards in the security business as well as Battery Management Systems (BMS) in the power management IC business.\\nIn the second half of 2023, the recovery of demand for major applications such as mobile is likely to be delayed due to depressed consumer sentiment and lower-than-expected reopening efforts in China.\\nThe System LSI Business is also seeking to resume supplying major customers by securing product performance for the flagship model and new business solutions aside from smartphones. For automotive SoC, it will continue focusing on winning orders from European OEMs in 2026.\\nThe Foundry Business saw its revenue increase quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter thanks to increased sales to some US customers, but operating profit declined significantly as utilization decreased due to fab expansion and uncertainties in short-term demand.\\nThe Foundry Business is smoothly mass producing its third product using GAA technology thanks to the stabilization of the 3-nanometer (nm) process, and the development of both the second generation of 3nm GAA technology and the 2nm GAA technology is on track and progressing well.\\nThe Foundry Business successfully held the SFF/SAFE 2023 event in the US and Korea, introducing its process roadmap and various technological innovations. It launched the Multi-Die Integration Alliance with ecosystem partners.\\nIn the second half of the year, although there are still considerable uncertainties, it expects demand to improve gradually.\\nThe Foundry Business will lay the foundation for growth by advancing the development completeness of the 3nm GAA process with improved Power, Performance and Area (PPA) and by expanding orders from large customers.\\nIt will keep striving to grow its product portfolio by continually developing mature processes, such as 8nm eMRAM, as well as 8-inch technologies for use in automotive applications.\\nSDC To Leverage New Technology To Build on Earnings\\nSDC posted KRW 6.48 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.84 trillion in operating profit for the second quarter.\\nFor mobile panels, SDC achieved results similar to the previous quarter's and thus maintained its market share by supplying OLED panels equipped with outstanding performance and technology.\\nFor the large panel business, SDC has been improving its business fundamentals with enhanced yield and productivity, and it is also strengthening the premium position of its QD-OLED products with the product mix upgrade centered on ultra-large 77-inch TVs.\\nIn the second half of the year, since SDC has several of its mobile panel customers due to release new products, it expects to see earnings improve. In particular, using its accumulated technological prowess in new areas such as HIAA and HOP, SDC aims to stay ahead of its competitors and seamlessly accommodate the mass production of new products from the customers.\\nFor large panels, uncertainty over demand is likely to persist in the second half. SDC will collaborate with its customers to boost sales of ultra-large TVs, which are performing well. In addition, SDC acquired eMagin, a microdisplay manufacturer, in May. SDC will actively develop technology to lead the Extended Reality (XR) display market, which is expected to grow rapidly.\\nMobile To Focus on New Foldable and Galaxy Ecosystem Devices in 2H\\nThe Mobile eXperience (MX) and Networks businesses posted KRW 25.55 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 3.04 trillion in operating profit for the second quarter.\\nOverall market demand declined from the previous quarter due to continued macroeconomic factors, including high interest rates and inflation.\\nSales decreased sequentially for the MX Business as the effect of the Galaxy S23 launch from Q1 faded. Mass market recovery was also delayed due to the continued economic downturn, affecting Q2 sales.\\nNevertheless, the Galaxy S23 series was able to achieve higher results than its predecessor in the first half, in terms of both volume and value.\\nThe MX Business's efforts to optimize operational efficiencies throughout R&D, manufacturing, and logistics, underpinned by stabilized prices of major raw materials, led it to maintain a double-digit margin.\\nFor the second half of 2023, the overall smartphone market is expected to return to year-on-year growth, especially in the premium market.\\nHowever, external forecasts for market growth have also been lowered, amid risks of a prolonged global economic downturn.\\nRegarding tablets, the overall market is expected to stay mostly flat, but the high-end segment is projected to increase.\\nThe MX Business will focus on the newly launched Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 5 series \\u2014 which feature refined and differentiated user experiences - further fortifying its leadership in the global foldable smartphone market.\\nFor the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy A series, the MX Business plans to enhance sales through close collaboration with its partners and sales programs tailored by region.\\nThe MX Business will also focus on boosting sales of its tablets and wearables, with a strong focus on its new high-end models, which were announced this week at the Galaxy Unpacked event.\\nThrough such activities and initiatives, the MX Business intends to grow its annual revenue in 2023, while securing sold double-digit profitability through enhanced operational efficiency.\\nVisual Display and Digital Appliances To Maintain Robust Performance in 2H\\nThe Visual Display and Digital Appliances businesses recorded KRW 14.39 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 0.74 trillion in operating profit for the second quarter.\\nDemand for TVs declined quarter-on-quarter due to seasonal spending trends, but the decrease in demand started to ease in comparison to the previous year. The Visual Display Business posted higher results year-on-year by focusing on sales of high-value-added products, such as Neo QLED/OLED/ultra-large TVs, and reducing overall costs.\\nIn the second half of 2023, the Visual Display Business expects seasonal strength to ease the decline in overall TV demand amid continued uncertainties in the business environment, while the premium market is projected to remain robust.\\nThe Visual Display Business will continue leading the industry through innovative products including 98-inch ultra-large screens, Micro LED lineups and the world's first large-sized OLED gaming monitor and also through differentiated marketing related to areas highly valued by its consumers, such as the environment, security and content.

With an expanded highly differentiated IoT portfolio, combined with our best-in-class High Performance Analog portfolio, we are well positioned to emerge stronger from this current cycle.\\\"\\nSecond Fiscal Quarter 2024 Outlook\\nBoth the GAAP and non-GAAP second fiscal quarter 2024 outlook below take into account, based on the Company's current estimates, export restrictions, inflationary pressure and other macroeconomic conditions. The Company is unable to predict the full impact such challenges may have on its future results of operations.\\nGAAP Second Fiscal Quarter 2024 Outlook\\nNet sales are expected to be in the range of $233.0 million to $243.0 million   \\nGAAP Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 42.6% to 44.8%   \\nGAAP SG&A expense is expected to be in the range of $63.2 million to $65.2 million   \\nGAAP R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $48.0 million to $50.0 million   \\nGAAP Intangible amortization expense is expected to be approximately $15.9 million   \\nGAAP Interest and other expense, net is expected to be approximately $23.2 million   \\nFully-diluted share count is expected to be approximately 64.1 million shares   \\nShare-based compensation is expected to be approximately $12.7 million, categorized as follows: $0.5 million cost of sales, $8.2 million SG&A, and $4.0 million R&D   \\nTransaction and integration expenses are expected to be approximately $10.0 million   \\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately $11.1 million   \\nDepreciation expense is expected to be approximately $9.1 million   \\nNon-GAAP Second Fiscal Quarter 2024 Outlook (see the list of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of Non-GAAP Gross margin, Non-GAAP SG&A expense, and Non-GAAP R&D expense to the most comparable GAAP measures set forth in the tables below under \\\"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Outlook\\\")\\nNon-GAAP Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 47.5% to 49.5%   \\nNon-GAAP SG&A expense is expected to be in the range of $45.0 million to $47.0 million   \\nNon-GAAP R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $44.0 million to $46.0 million   \\nNon-GAAP normalized tax rate for fiscal year 2024 is expected to be approximately 12%   \\nNon-GAAP Diluted (loss) earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $(0.02) to $0.06   \\nThe Company is unable to include a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP normalized tax rate and non-GAAP Diluted loss per share to the corresponding GAAP measures as this is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the impact of share-based awards and the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets that are excluded from these non-GAAP measures. The Company expects the variability of the above charges to have a potentially significant impact on its GAAP financial results.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, this release includes a presentation of select non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's non-GAAP measures of gross margin, SG&A expense, R&D expense, operating margin, net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders, diluted (loss) earnings per share and normalized tax rate exclude the following items, if any:\\nShare-based compensation   \\nAmortization of purchased intangibles, impairments and credit loss reserves   \\nRestructuring and transaction costs (including costs associated with the acquisition of Sierra Wireless), and other acquisition or disposition-related gains or losses   \\nShare-based compensation acceleration expense related to the acquisition of Sierra Wireless   \\nLitigation expenses or dispute settlement charges or gains   \\nCumulative other reserves associated with historical activity including environmental and pension   \\nEquity method (loss) income   \\nInterest income from debt investments   \\nTo provide additional insight into the Company's second quarter outlook, this release also includes a presentation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude the items identified above because such items are either operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred by the Company in the normal course of the Company's business operations, or are not reflective of the Company's core results over time. These excluded items may include recurring as well as non-recurring items, and no inference should be made that all of these adjustments, charges, costs or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. For example: certain restructuring and integration-related expenses (which consist of employee termination costs, facility closure or lease termination costs, and contract termination costs) may be considered recurring given the Company's ongoing efforts to be more cost effective and efficient; certain acquisition and disposition-related adjustments or expenses may be deemed recurring given the Company's regular evaluation of potential transactions and investments; and certain litigation expenses or dispute settlement charges or gains (which may include estimated losses for which the Company may have established a reserve, as well as any actual settlements, judgments, or other resolutions against, or in favor of, the Company related to litigation, arbitration, disputes or similar matters, and insurance recoveries received by the Company related to such matters) may be viewed as recurring given that the Company may from time to time be involved in, and may resolve, litigation, arbitration, disputes, and similar matters.\\nNotwithstanding that certain adjustments, charges, costs or expenses may be considered recurring, in order to provide meaningful comparisons, the Company believes that it is appropriate to exclude such items because they are not reflective of the Company's core results and tend to vary based on timing, frequency and magnitude.\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the user's overall understanding of the Company's comparable financial performance between periods. In addition, the Company's management generally excludes the items noted above when managing and evaluating the performance of the business. The financial statements provided with this release include reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP measures for the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2023 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, along with a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures (other than the non-GAAP normalized tax rate and non-GAAP Diluted (loss) earnings per share) to their most comparable GAAP measures for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The Company adopted a full-year, normalized tax rate for the computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision in order to provide better comparability across the interim reporting periods by reducing the quarterly variability in non-GAAP tax rates that can occur throughout the year. In estimating the full-year non-GAAP normalized tax rate, the Company utilized a full-year financial projection that considers multiple factors such as changes to the Company's current operating structure, existing positions in various tax jurisdictions, the effect of key tax law changes, and other significant tax matters to the extent they are applicable to the full fiscal year financial projection. In addition to the adjustments described above, this normalized tax rate excludes the impact of share-based awards and the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. For fiscal year 2024, the Company's projected non-GAAP normalized tax rate is 12% and will be applied to each quarter of fiscal year 2024. The Company's non-GAAP normalized tax rate on non-GAAP net income may be adjusted during the year to account for events or trends that the Company believes materially impact the original annual non-GAAP normalized tax rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, acquisitions, entity structures or operational changes and other significant events. These additional non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies.\\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\\nThis press release contains \\\"forward-looking statements\\\" within the meaning of the \\\"safe harbor\\\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, based on the Company's current expectations, estimates and projections about its operations, industry, financial condition, performance, results of operations, and liquidity.

The company recorded revenue of 7.306 trillion won, operating loss of 2.882 trillion won (with operating margin of negative 39%), and net loss of 2.988 trillion won (with net margin of negative 41%) for the three-month period ended June 30, 2023.\\n\\\"Amid an expansion in generative artificial intelligence (AI) market, which has largely been centered on ChatGPT, demand for AI server memory has increased rapidly,\\\" the company said. \\\"As a result, sales of premium products such as HBM3 and DDR5 increased, leading to a 44% sequential increase in revenue for the second quarter, while operating loss narrowed by 15%.\\\"\\nAccording to SK hynix, sales of both DRAM and NAND products increased in the second quarter, with higher average selling price (ASP) of DRAM largely contributing to revenue growth. Although the price for general DRAM products such as DDR4 continued to decline on sluggish PC and smartphone demands, DRAM blended ASP rose in the quarter, offset by increased sales in high-end products used for AI servers.\\nMoreover, lower inventory valuation loss, as well as the company's ongoing cost reduction efforts, helped reduce operating loss.\\n* Operating margin in 1H: 1Q23 -67% \\u2192 2Q23 -39%\\nAt the quarterly earnings conference call held today, the company said the demand for AI memory will continue to stay robust, and that a clearer effect of production reduction by memory companies can be seen.\\nSK hynix, thereby, aims to expand sales of high-end DRAM products, including HBM3, DDR5 and LPDDR5, as well as 176-layer based SSD products, which would help accelerate earnings improvement.\\nThe company also announced that it will improve the quality and yields of 1b-nanometer, the fifth generation of the 10nm process technology, DRAM and 238-layer NAND this year and expand the scale of mass production once the industry upturn is visible.

These non-GAAP measures supplement our GAAP measures of performance or liquidity and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance or liquidity. Non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, free cash, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin do not have uniform definitions. These measures, as calculated by Vishay, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

Operating income improvement was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.   \\nClient segment revenue was $2.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year driven by Ryzen\\u2122 mobile processor sales. Client processor ASP increased year-over-year driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales. Operating income was $676 million, or 32% of revenue, compared to $538 million or 31% a year ago. Operating income improvement was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses.   \\nGaming segment revenue was $1.7 billion, up 32% year-over-year driven by higher semi-custom product sales, partially offset by a decline in gaming graphics revenue. Operating income was $187 million, or 11% of revenue, compared to $175 million or 14% a year ago. Operating income improvement was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating margin was lower primarily due to lower graphics revenue and higher operating expenses.   \\nEmbedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up 2,228% year-over-year driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded revenue. Operating income was $641 million, or 51% of revenue, compared to $6 million or 11% a year ago.

The U.S. government played a significant role in the development of semiconductor technology, and domestic research and production have long been matters of intense congressional interest. U.S.headquartered semiconductor firms accounted for about half of worldwide semiconductor sales in 2015.1 However, U.S.headquartered producers face stiff competition from firms headquartered in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan moreover, the Chinese government has identified global leadership in semiconductors as a national priority. Further, the United States accounts for a diminishing share of global semiconductor production capacity, as manufacturers establish plants in locations where generous subsidies are available or customers in user industries, such as electronic products manufacturing, are nearby. In July 2015, Members of Congress concerned about the industrys competitiveness formed a Semiconductor Caucus to support increased federal funding for semiconductor research activities, among other objectives. Semiconductor Industry Basics A semiconductor chip also known simply as a \\\"semiconductor\\\" or \\\"chip\\\" is a tiny electronic device generally smaller than a postage stamp comprised of billions of components that store, move, and process data. These functions are made possible by the unique properties of semiconducting materials, such as silicon and germanium, which allow for the precise control of the flow of electrical current. Semiconductors are the enabling technology of the information age. Semiconductors allow computers to run software applications, such as email, Internet browsers, and word processing and spreadsheet programs and to store documents, photographs, videos, music, and other data. They also provide the \\\"brains,\\\" memory, and data communication capabilities of countless other products, from cell phones and gaming systems to aircraft and industrial machinery to military equipment and weapons. Even many products with roots in mechanical systems are now heavily dependent on chipbased electronics: one car manufacturer asserts that some of its models incorporate as many as 6,000 semiconductors. And one expert on software in cars estimates that premiumclass automobiles can contain close to 100 million lines of software code instructions that the chips use to control the vehicle. Source: Congressional Research Service https:fas.orgsgpcrsmiscR44544.pdf World Semiconductor Trade Statistics The Chapters of the four world regions appoint 13 directors who form the Board of Directors supervision. Each region nominates a Vice Chairman who together with the Chairman forms the Executive Commitee operational steering. The Chairman is elected by the Committee, the assembly of representatives of all member companies. WSTS has two salaried employees, the Administrator and the Assistant to Administrator. The four regions Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific have regional organizations of WSTS member companies, the so called Chapters . Chapters meet regularly and develop policies and proposals for the operation of WSTS. In addition the Chapters appoint their representatives in the Board of Directors and elect a Vice Chairman , who represents the respective region in the Executive Committee . The Chairman of the Executive Committe however is elected by the Committee, which in turn is composed of one representative of each member company. The tenure of WSTS officers is 18 month. Reelection for a second period is possible. Communication between these various functions happens by correspondence, through this Internet Portal and by meetings. Chapters meet two to four times a year, the Board of Directors convenes twice a year in May and October and the Executive Committe meets at least twice a year, too. Also the Committee has two meetings per year, normally cotimed and colocated with the venue of the Board of Directors and the Executive Commitee. Obviously the Chapter meetings take place in the respective region, whereas all other meetings with worldwide participation rotate among the regions. The currently established practice is that spring meetings alternate between Japan and Asia Pacific, whereas autumn meetings alternate between Americas and Europe. This scheme provides equitable opportunities for all Committee members to participate. WSTS cooperates closely with the regional Semiconductor Industry Associations. These organizations participate as observers in all major meetings and provide an alternative feedback channel from the semiconductor industry, supplementary to the information that is brought in by the company representatives in the Committee. Semiconductor industry organizations hold also distribution licenses for WSTS reports and thereby provide a commercial distribution channel for these reports to nonsemiconductor companies and organizations. As WSTS collects revenue data from competitors it is mandatory that such data is compiled and consolidated by Data Collection Agents before this data is conveyed to WSTS for the generation of statistic reports. In order to provide best protection to individual member companies trade data, WSTS uses three Data Collection Agents, one for consolidation of Japanese member companies data, one for consolidation of Europe member companies data and another one who consolidates the data of all Asia Pacific and Americas companies. The latter Data Collection Agent also performs the worldwide consolidation of the data from the regions. Data Collection Agents have the typical professional qualification of certified public accountants and are service providers to both the member companies and WSTS in an arm length relationship. The WSTS employees, the Administrator and the Assistant to Administrator are responsible for the operation of all WSTS programs, for the publication of all reports and any other content of this Internet Portal, for the organization of meetings, for member services and for the financial management of the WSTS.

Business Outlook In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, Applied expects net sales to be approximately 6.35 billion, plus or minus 300 million, which includes the expected impact of ongoing supply chain challenges. NonGAAP adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of 1.75 to 2.05. This outlook for nonGAAP adjusted diluted EPS excludes known charges related to completed acquisitions of 0.01 per share, includes the normalized tax benefit of sharebased compensation of 0.01 per share and includes a net income tax benefit related to intraentity intangible asset transfers of 0.02 per share, but does not reflect any items that are unknown at this time, such as any additional charges related to acquisitions or other nonoperational or unusual items, as well as other tax related items, which we are not able to predict without unreasonable efforts due to their inherent uncertainty. First Quarter Reportable Segment Information Use of NonGAAP Adjusted Financial Measures Applied provides investors with certain nonGAAP adjusted financial measures, which are adjusted for the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions restructuring and severance charges and any associated adjustments certain incremental expenses related to COVID19 impairments of assets gain or loss on strategic investments certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments. On a nonGAAP basis, the tax effect related to sharebased compensation is recognized ratably over the fiscal year. Reconciliations of these nonGAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this release. Management uses these nonGAAP adjusted financial measures to evaluate the companys operating and financial performance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program. Applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of its performance and investors ability to review the companys business from the same perspective as the companys management, and facilitate comparisons of this periods results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of Applieds ongoing operating performance. There are limitations in using nonGAAP financial measures because the nonGAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, may be different from nonGAAP financial measures used by other companies, and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

These forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and MACOM undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Discussion Regarding the Use of Historical and ForwardLooking NonGAAP Financial Measures In addition to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles \\\"GAAP\\\" reporting, MACOM provides investors with financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP, such as: nonGAAP gross profit and gross margin, nonGAAP operating expenses, nonGAAP income from operations and operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, nonGAAP net income, nonGAAP diluted earnings per share, nonGAAP diluted shares, nonGAAP income tax rate, nonGAAP interest expense and nonGAAP free cash flow. In this release or elsewhere, we may alternatively refer to such nonGAAP measures as \\\"adjusted\\\" measures. This nonGAAP information excludes the effect, where applicable, of intangible amortization expense, sharebased compensation expense, warrant liability expense, noncash interest, equity method investment gains and losses and the tax effect of each nonGAAP adjustment. Management believes these excluded items are not reflective of our underlying performance and uses these nonGAAP financial measures to: evaluate our ongoing operating performance and compare it against prior periods, make operating decisions, forecast future periods, evaluate potential acquisitions, compare our operating performance against peer companies and assess certain compensation programs. The exclusion of these items from our nonGAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual. We believe this nonGAAP financial information provides additional insight into our ongoing performance and have therefore chosen to provide this information to investors to help them evaluate the results of our ongoing operations and enable more meaningful periodtoperiod comparisons. These nonGAAP measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and nonGAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. We have not provided a reconciliation with respect to any forwardlooking nonGAAP financial data presented because we do not have and cannot reliably estimate certain key inputs required to calculate the most comparable GAAP financial data, such as the future price per share of our common stock for purposes of calculating the value of our common stock warrant liability, future acquisition costs, the possibility and impact of any litigation costs, changes in our GAAP effective tax rate and impairment charges. We believe these unknown inputs are likely to have a significant impact on any estimate of the comparable GAAP financial data. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on nonGAAP financial measures and are urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. NonGAAP financial measures may have limited value as analytical tools because they may exclude certain expenses that some investors consider important in evaluating our operating performance or ongoing business performance. Further, nonGAAP financial measures may have limited value for purposes of drawing comparisons between companies because different companies may calculate similarly titled nonGAAP financial measures in different ways because nonGAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Additional information and management s assessment regarding why certain items are excluded from our nonGAAP measures are summarized below: Amortization Expense is related to acquired intangible assets which are based upon valuation methodologies, and are generally amortized over the expected life of the intangible asset at the time of acquisition, which may result in amortization amounts that vary over time. This noncash expense is not considered by management in making operating decisions. ShareBased Compensation Expense includes sharebased compensation expense for awards that are equity and liability classified on our balance sheet and the related employer tax expense at vesting. Sharebased compensation expense is partially outside of our control due to factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our operating performance during the period in which the expense is incurred. It is an expense based upon valuation methodologies and assumptions that vary over time, and the amount of the expense can vary significantly between companies. Sharebased compensation expense amounts are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Warrant Liability Expense is associated with marktomarket fair value adjustments, which are largely based on the value of our common stock, which may vary from period to period due to factors such as stock price volatility. We believe these amounts are not correlated to future business operations and do not reflect our ongoing operations. Noncash Interest, Net includes amounts associated with the amortization of certain fees associated with the establishment or amendment of our credit agreement, term loans and convertible notes that are being amortized over the life of the agreements. We believe these amounts are noncash in nature, are not correlated to future business operations and do not reflect our ongoing operations. Equity Method Investment GainsLosses primarily includes noncash gains and losses associated with a nonmarketable equity investment we had in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC and the 118.2 million cash gain on the sale of this investment in December 2021. We believe these items are not correlated to future business operations and including such amounts does not reflect our ongoing operations. Tax Effect of NonGAAP Adjustments includes adjustments to arrive at an estimate of our nonGAAP income tax rate associated with our nonGAAP income over a period of time. We determine our nonGAAP income tax rate using applicable rates in taxing jurisdictions and assessing certain factors including our historical and forecast earnings by jurisdiction, discrete items, cash taxes paid in relation to our nonGAAP net income before income taxes and our ability to realize tax assets. We generally assess this nonGAAP income tax rate quarterly and have utilized 5 for fiscal year 2021 and our first fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our historical effective income tax rate under GAAP has varied significantly from our nonGAAP income tax rate due primarily to changes in fair values of the common stock warrant liability, which are excluded from our adjusted net income and are neither deductible nor taxable for tax purposes, gains or losses associated with our equity method investment in a private business, income taxed in foreign jurisdictions at generally lower tax rates, intangible impairments, research and development tax credits and merger expenses. We believe it is beneficial for management to review our nonGAAP income tax rate on a consistent basis over periods of time. Items such as those noted above may have a significant impact on our GAAP income tax expense and associated effective tax rate over time. Adjusted EBITDA is a calculation that adds depreciation expense to our adjusted income from operations. Management reviews and utilizes this measure for operational analysis purposes. We believe competitors and others in the financial industry also utilize this measure for analysis purposes. Free Cash Flow is a calculation that starts with cash flow from operating activities and reduces this amount by our capital expenditures in the applicable period. Management reviews and utilizes this measure for cash flow analysis purposes. We believe competitors and others in the financial industry also utilize this measure for analyzing a companys cash flow. Incremental Shares is the number of potential shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and warrants that were not included in the calculation of our GAAP diluted shares, as the impact would have been antidilutive. We believe competitors and others in the financial industry utilize this measure for analysis purposes. https:ir.macom.comnewsreleasesnewsreleasedetailsmacomreportsfiscalfirstquarter2022financialresults Atmel Corporation Atmel is a worldwide leader in the design and manufacture of microcontrollers, capacitive touch solutions, advanced logic, mixedsignal, nonvolatile memory and radio frequency RF components.

GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was 352.8 million, or 0.62 per diluted share, up from GAAP net income of 36.2 million, or 0.07 per diluted share, in the prior years third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, GAAP net income was significantly adversely impacted by purchase accounting adjustments associated with our acquisitions. NonGAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 was a record at 681.7 million, or 1.20 per diluted share, up from nonGAAP net income of 444.9 million, or 0.81 per diluted share, in the prior years third fiscal quarter. For the third quarters of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, our nonGAAP results exclude the effect of sharebased compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition, professional services associated with certain legal matters, IT security remediation costs, noncash interest expense on our convertible debentures, losses on the settlement of debt, and gains related to equity investments. For the third quarters of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, our nonGAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the applicable fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. A reconciliation of our nonGAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release. Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 25.3 cents per share, up 9.1 from the cash dividend paid last quarter and up 29.7 from the year ago quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 8, 2022 to stockholders of record on February 22, 2022. \\\"Our December quarter results continued to be strong, with revenue growing 6.5 sequentially and 30.0 yearoveryear despite ongoing manufacturing capacity constraints,\\\" said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. \\\"December quarter revenue, nonGAAP gross margin, nonGAAP operating margin, and nonGAAP EPS were all records. Our December 2021 quarter operating margin of 44.6 was up 210 basis points from 42.5 in the September 2021 quarter and was well above the high end of our guidance.\\\" Mr. Moorthy added, \\\"Overall business conditions remained very strong in the December quarter with high levels of bookings and record backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters, accentuated by our Preferred Supply Program which continues to be greater than 50 of our aggregate backlog and 100 of our backlog in the most constrained capacity areas. Similar to the September quarter, in the December quarter demand outpaced the capacity improvements we implemented, resulting in our unsupported backlog continuing to climb and our lead times stretching out.\\\" Steve Sanghi, Microchips Executive Chair, said, \\\"Microchips Board of Directors approved a sequential increase in our dividend of 9.1, to a record 25.3 cents per share, up from our November dividend of 23.2 cents per share. The dividend announced today also represents a 29.7 yearoveryear increase. Our Board of Directors is now targeting to increase our dividend at least 9 sequentially, which is up from the 7 sequential increases communicated at our Investor and Analyst Day on November 8, 2021.\\\" Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, \\\"We continued to aggressively pay down our debt with another 362.7 million of payments during the December quarter, reflecting a cumulative debt pay down of 4.77 billion over the past 14 quarters, as we have actively managed the working capital requirements for the business. In the December quarter, we exchanged 96.2 million of dilutive convertible debentures for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. We also refinanced our revolving line of credit to be in line with our investment grade rating and decreased the size of the facility from 3.6 billion to 2.75 billion. We remain focused on continuing to enhance our capital structure in the future.\\\" Mr. Moorthy concluded, \\\"Our backlog for the March quarter is very strong. We also have considerable backlog requested by customers in the March quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from last quarter. Additionally, our supply in the March quarter is expected to be adversely impacted by the COVID19 Omicron variant which has increased the level of factory workforce absentees. Given this backdrop, we expect our net sales in the March quarter to be up between 2 and 5 sequentially. At the midpoint of our guidance for the March quarter, net sales will be 24 higher than the year ago quarter.\\\" Microchips Highlights for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2021: Unveiled its new ISO 26262 functional safety packages simplifying design of ASIL B and ASIL C safety applications using dsPIC, PIC18 and AVR microcontrollers, accelerating development and certification of automotive safety applications.

Expanded our functionalsafetycertified family of capacitive maXTouch touchscreen controllers, adding two new IECUL 60730 Class B certified touchscreen controllers, the MXT448UDHA and MXT640UDHA, for the home appliance market. Announced our collaboration with Mersen on their 150 kilovoltampere kVA threephase silicon carbide Power Stack Reference Design, providing Microchips Silicon Carbide MOSFETs and Digital Gate Drivers. Introduced the TimeProvider 4100 Release 2.3 precision timing grandmaster for communication networks, meeting the industrys latest IEEE 1588 v2.1 2019 security standard for protection of timing systems while providing an increased level of deployment flexibility and scalability. Microchips inventory days in the March 2022 quarter are expected to be in the range of 120 to 125 days, compared to 116 days on December 31, 2021. Our actual inventory level will depend on the inventory that our distributors decide to hold to support their customers, overall demand for our products, and our production levels. Capital expenditures for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 are expected to be between 135 million and 145 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2022 are expected to be between 390 million and 400 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing capabilities to support the expected growth of our business. Under the GAAP revenue recognition standard, which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. Therefore, the elements of our internal performance and executive and employee compensation metrics that are based on sales and operating results are measured using the value of the endmarket demand for our products. We use endmarket demand for these purposes because we do not believe that the underlying value of our business benefits from increases in the value of inventory that is held in the supply chain. As many of our products are designed into customer applications with relatively long lives, such value is only realized when the endmarket demand is created, and the supply chain sells the inventory to the end customer. We define endmarket demand as the net dollar amount of our products, licensing revenue, and other services delivered to our direct nondistributor customers and by our distributors to their customers. We are able to calculate endmarket demand based on information that our distributors provide us about their product shipments to their customers and inventory holdings. The value of endmarket demand from our distributors is calculated as the net transaction value of these shipments. We believe that our endmarket demand metric reflects true endmarket demand based on when product is sold to direct customers or by our distributors to an end customer. We believe the use of endmarket demand is also important to investors and users of our financial statements as it reflects the final outcome of our sales activities, whereas our GAAP net sales are based on estimates made earlier in or before the end of the process of creating and fulfilling demand is complete. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires. Management uses endmarket demand to manage and assess the profitability of our business and when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose endmarket demand metric because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it provides better information regarding endmarket demand for our products. Therefore, we believe that it is useful to investors for us to disclose endmarket demand.

A reconciliation of our nonGAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release. Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 25.3 cents per share, up 9.1 from the cash dividend paid last quarter and up 29.7 from the year ago quarter. The quarterly dividend is payable on March 8, 2022 to stockholders of record on February 22, 2022. \\\"Our December quarter results continued to be strong, with revenue growing 6.5 sequentially and 30.0 yearoveryear despite ongoing manufacturing capacity constraints,\\\" said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Executive Officer. \\\"December quarter revenue, nonGAAP gross margin, nonGAAP operating margin, and nonGAAP EPS were all records. Our December 2021 quarter operating margin of 44.6 was up 210 basis points from 42.5 in the September 2021 quarter and was well above the high end of our guidance.\\\" Mr. Moorthy added, \\\"Overall business conditions remained very strong in the December quarter with high levels of bookings and record backlog for product to be shipped over multiple quarters, accentuated by our Preferred Supply Program which continues to be greater than 50 of our aggregate backlog and 100 of our backlog in the most constrained capacity areas. Similar to the September quarter, in the December quarter demand outpaced the capacity improvements we implemented, resulting in our unsupported backlog continuing to climb and our lead times stretching out.\\\" Steve Sanghi, Microchips Executive Chair, said, \\\"Microchips Board of Directors approved a sequential increase in our dividend of 9.1, to a record 25.3 cents per share, up from our November dividend of 23.2 cents per share. The dividend announced today also represents a 29.7 yearoveryear increase. Our Board of Directors is now targeting to increase our dividend at least 9 sequentially, which is up from the 7 sequential increases communicated at our Investor and Analyst Day on November 8, 2021.\\\" Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, \\\"We continued to aggressively pay down our debt with another 362.7 million of payments during the December quarter, reflecting a cumulative debt pay down of 4.77 billion over the past 14 quarters, as we have actively managed the working capital requirements for the business. In the December quarter, we exchanged 96.2 million of dilutive convertible debentures for cash and shares of our common stock. We used cash generation during the quarter to fund the principal amount of the convertible debt exchanges and we believe that these transactions will benefit stockholders by significantly reducing share count dilution to the extent our stock price appreciates over time. We also refinanced our revolving line of credit to be in line with our investment grade rating and decreased the size of the facility from 3.6 billion to 2.75 billion. We remain focused on continuing to enhance our capital structure in the future.\\\" Mr. Moorthy concluded, \\\"Our backlog for the March quarter is very strong. We also have considerable backlog requested by customers in the March quarter that currently cannot be fulfilled until later quarters despite us growing capacity from last quarter. Additionally, our supply in the March quarter is expected to be adversely impacted by the COVID19 Omicron variant which has increased the level of factory workforce absentees. Given this backdrop, we expect our net sales in the March quarter to be up between 2 and 5 sequentially. At the midpoint of our guidance for the March quarter, net sales will be 24 higher than the year ago quarter.\\\" Microchips Highlights for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2021: Unveiled its new ISO 26262 functional safety packages simplifying design of ASIL B and ASIL C safety applications using dsPIC, PIC18 and AVR microcontrollers, accelerating development and certification of automotive safety applications.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Outlook: Microchips inventory days in the March 2022 quarter are expected to be in the range of 120 to 125 days, compared to 116 days on December 31, 2021. Our actual inventory level will depend on the inventory that our distributors decide to hold to support their customers, overall demand for our products, and our production levels. Capital expenditures for the quarter ending March 31, 2022 are expected to be between 135 million and 145 million. Capital expenditures for all of fiscal 2022 are expected to be between 390 million and 400 million. We continue to add capital equipment to maintain, grow and operate our internal manufacturing capabilities to support the expected growth of our business. Under the GAAP revenue recognition standard, which we adopted on April 1, 2018, we are required to recognize revenue when control of the product changes from us to a customer or distributor. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating demand for our products in the end markets we serve and not on moving inventory into our distribution network. Therefore, the elements of our internal performance and executive and employee compensation metrics that are based on sales and operating results are measured using the value of the endmarket demand for our products. We use endmarket demand for these purposes because we do not believe that the underlying value of our business benefits from increases in the value of inventory that is held in the supply chain. As many of our products are designed into customer applications with relatively long lives, such value is only realized when the endmarket demand is created, and the supply chain sells the inventory to the end customer. We define endmarket demand as the net dollar amount of our products, licensing revenue, and other services delivered to our direct nondistributor customers and by our distributors to their customers. We are able to calculate endmarket demand based on information that our distributors provide us about their product shipments to their customers and inventory holdings. The value of endmarket demand from our distributors is calculated as the net transaction value of these shipments. We believe that our endmarket demand metric reflects true endmarket demand based on when product is sold to direct customers or by our distributors to an end customer. We believe the use of endmarket demand is also important to investors and users of our financial statements as it reflects the final outcome of our sales activities, whereas our GAAP net sales are based on estimates made earlier in or before the end of the process of creating and fulfilling demand is complete. We also manage our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including our distributor relationships, towards the goal of having our products available at the time and location the end customer desires. Management uses endmarket demand to manage and assess the profitability of our business and when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose endmarket demand metric because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it provides better information regarding endmarket demand for our products. Therefore, we believe that it is useful to investors for us to disclose endmarket demand. Our determination of endmarket demand metric might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures: Our nonGAAP adjustments, where applicable, include the effect of sharebased compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities including intangible asset amortization, severance, and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions including legal fees and expenses for litigation and investigations related to our Microsemi acquisition, professional services associated with certain legal matters, IT security remediation costs, noncash interest expense on our convertible debentures, losses on the settlement of debt, and gains related to equity investments. For the third quarters of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, our nonGAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for the fiscal year, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We are required to estimate the cost of certain forms of sharebased compensation, including employee stock options, restricted stock units, and our employee stock purchase plan, and to record a commensurate expense in our income statement. Sharebased compensation expense is a noncash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is affected by the price of our stock at the date of grant. The price of our stock is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management. Our other nonGAAP adjustments are either noncash expenses, unusual or infrequent items, or other expenses related to transactions. Management excludes all of these items from its internal operating forecasts and models. We are using nonGAAP operating expenses in dollars, including nonGAAP research and development expenses and nonGAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, nonGAAP other expense, net, and nonGAAP income tax rate, which exclude the items noted above, as applicable, to permit additional analysis of our performance. Management believes these nonGAAP measures are useful to investors because they enhance the understanding of our historical financial performance and comparability between periods. Many of our investors have requested that we disclose this nonGAAP information because they believe it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes noncash and other charges that many investors feel may obscure our underlying operating results. Management uses nonGAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of our business and for compensation purposes. We also use our nonGAAP results when developing and monitoring our budgets and spending. Our determination of these nonGAAP measures might not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it should not be construed as a substitute for amounts determined in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations associated with using these nonGAAP measures, including that they exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. Management compensates for this by presenting information on both a GAAP and nonGAAP basis for investors and providing reconciliations of the GAAP and nonGAAP results. Generally, gross margin fluctuates over time, driven primarily by the mix of products sold and licensing revenue variances in manufacturing yields fixed cost absorption wafer fab loading levels costs of wafers from foundries inventory reserves pricing pressures in our nonproprietary product lines and competitive and economic conditions. Operating expenses fluctuate over time, primarily due to net sales and profit levels. Diluted Common Shares Outstanding can vary for, among other things, the trading price of our common stock, the exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the potential for incremental dilutive shares from our convertible debentures additional information regarding our share count is available in the investor relations section of our website under the heading \\\"Supplemental Financial Information\\\", and repurchases or issuances of shares of our common stock. The diluted common shares outstanding presented in the guidance table above assumes an average Microchip stock price in the March 2022 quarter between 75 and 85 per share however, we make no prediction as to what our actual share price will be for such period or any other period and we cannot estimate what our stock option exercise activity will be during the quarter. https:ww1.microchip.comdownloadsaemDocumentsdocumentsinvestorpressreleaseMCHPReportsRecordResultsforQ3FY22.020322.pdf Nvidia Corporation NVIDIAs NASDAQ: NVDA invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics and revolutionized parallel computing.

Selected financial results for the quarter are shown below with comparable periods: Selected financial results for 2021 and 2020 are shown below: FIRST QUARTER 2022 OUTLOOK The following table outlines onsemis projected first quarter of 2022 GAAP and nonGAAP outlook. FINANCIALS Convertible Notes, Noncash Interest Expense is calculated pursuant to FASBs Accounting Standards Codification Topic 470: Debt. Diluted shares outstanding can vary as a result of, among other things, the vesting of restricted stock units, the incremental dilutive shares from the Companys convertible senior subordinated notes, and the repurchase or the issuance of stock or convertible notes or the sale of treasury shares. With the adoption of the new accounting standard, the GAAP diluted shares outstanding assumes settling the principal and excess over par value in shares of the Companys common stock for the 1.625 Notes and only the excess over par value in shares of the Companys common stock for the 0 Notes, according to the terms of such notes. The nonGAAP diluted shares outstanding includes the shares that are not covered by the Companys hedge transaction issued concurrently with such notes. In periods when the quarterly average stock price exceeds 30.70 for the 1.625 Notes and 74.34 for the 0 Notes, the dilutive impact of the warrants issued concurrently with such notes are included in the GAAP and nonGAAP diluted shares outstanding. Calculations are based on the Companys stock price as of December 31, 2021. Special items may include: amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles expensing of appraised inventory fair market value stepup purchased inprocess research and development expenses restructuring, asset impairments and other, net goodwill impairment charges gains and losses on debt prepayment noncash interest expense actuarial gains losses on pension plans and other pension benefits and certain other special items, as necessary. These special items are out of our control and could change significantly from period to period. As a result, we are not able to reasonably estimate and separately present the individual impact or probable significance of these special items, and we are similarly unable to provide a reconciliation of the nonGAAP measures. The reconciliation that is unavailable would include a forwardlooking income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows in accordance with GAAP. For this reason, we use a projected range of the aggregate amount of special items in order to calculate our projected nonGAAP operating expense outlook. We believe these nonGAAP measures provide important supplemental information to investors. We use these measures, together with GAAP measures, for internal managerial purposes and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons. However, we do not, and you should not, rely on nonGAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. We believe that nonGAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when taken together with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures that we also provide in our releases, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Because nonGAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nonGAAP financial measures, even if they have similar names. https:www.onsemi.comcompanynewsmediapressannouncementsenonsemireportsfourthquarterand2021financialresults Qualcomm Incorporated Qualcomms technologies powered the smartphone revolution and connected billions of people.

For NAND, server SSD demand is expected to be robust thanks to continuing investments, mainly in data centers. PC demand will recover, mainly for laptops, along with gradual improvements in component shortage. And for mobile, despite being amid slow seasonality, Samsung expects the highdensity trend for storage to persist as manufacturers launch new 5G models. In 2022, the Memory Business expects server demand to grow, attributed to increase in IT investments and new highcore CPUs, while 5G lineup expansion is likely to increase contentperbox for mobile, although challenges related to supply issues and COVID19 are likely to persist. Therefore, the Company will continue to reinforce its leadership by expanding supply of highperformance products and increasing application of its industryleading EUV technology. The System LSI Business reached the highestever quarterly sales thanks to increased demand for SoCs, DDIs and PMICs, but profit fell slightly due to the influence of special bonuses. In the fourth quarter, the Company began supplying the 4nanometer AMD GPUpowered SoC and expanded adoption for the 108megapixel image sensors from customers.

In 2022, the System LSI Business hopes to see its performance grow further by maximizing supply of 5G SoCs for the volume zone and 108 and 200megapixel sensors. The Foundry Business set a new revenue high for the fourth quarter as it increased sales for largescale HPC customers and secured new orders in HPC application. In addition, the Company confirmed US Taylor and domestic new fab investment amidst global semiconductor supply chain stabilization efforts. However, profitability fell slightly due to the increase in cost caused by the delay of the advanced node rampup. In the first quarter, Samsung will focus on improving its advanced process yield to improve its supply stability. Also, the Company will continue technical leadership through mass production of the 1st generation GAA process in the first half of 2022. For this year, Samsung expects supply to remain tight due to rising penetration of 5G, solid HPC demand, growing outsourcing from IDM players and continued needs for securing safety inventory. The Company aims to exceed market growth by expanding capacity at advanced nodes, adjusting prices and adding new customers. Mobile Panel Earnings Improved To Focus on OLED and QD Displays in 2022 The Display Panel Business posted KRW 9.06 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 1.32 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter. The mobile panel business saw its earnings continue to improve, primarily driven by solid demand for newly launched smartphones from its key customers. In addition, increased sales of products for new applications including laptops and gaming consoles contributed to the mobile panel earnings. For the large panel business, however, its losses widen in the fourth quarter due to declines in LCD ASP and initial costs related to QD displays. Looking ahead to the first quarter, Samsung forecasts improved results yearonyear for the mobile panel business, thanks to a release of new smartphones by its major customers and a growing customer base in the foldable display. In the large panel business, losses are expected to be partially mitigated on the mass production of QD displays as TVs and monitors adopting QD displays are to make debut in the markets. In 2022, solid demand for OLED is likely to continue despite macro environmentrelated risks, based on the rising penetration of 5G and growth of the foldable market. Samsung will pursue a balanced business structure for stable growth by expanding Flexible OLED to midrange devices as well as diversifying applications for Rigid OLED including IT, gaming and automotive. For the large panel business, the Company will strive to secure technology leadership in the evergrowing premium segment with QD displays while winding down its LCD line as planned. Mobile To Focus on Flagship, Strengthening Mass Market 5G Lineup The MX and Networks businesses posted KRW 28.95 trillion in consolidated revenue and KRW 2.66 trillion in operating profit for the fourth quarter.

AD record performance, combined with strong ISM and TME performance, also led to a record for total AIT, and drove stronger overall profitability. The strength in our business clearly demonstrates the successful execution of our strategy.\\\" \\\"Record Q3 revenue was driven primarily from sequential growth in AD, DCG and TME, leading to total sequential revenue growth of 8 and yearoveryear growth of 26, the fifth consecutive quarter of doubledigit yearoveryear growth,\\\" said Brice Hill, Xilinx CFO. \\\"Overall strong revenues and business mix, in addition to positive impacts from strategic venture investments, drove record earnings this quarter. Our platform strategy continues to progress as Adaptive SoC revenue grew 5 sequentially and 30 yearoveryear, representing 28 of total revenue. \\\"We saw strong free cash flow this quarter of 351 million, or 35 of revenue, reflecting our efficient cash generating business model. Please note, the increase in inventory to 106 days is primarily driven by supply cost increases and does not reflect a significant increase in unit inventory.\\\" Products are classified as follows: Advanced Products: Versal, UltraScale, UltraScale and 7series product families, and production boards business composed of Alveo, Solarflare, Network, and SystemOnModules.

Commentary on AMD Transaction As announced on October 27, 2020, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD intends to acquire Xilinx in an allstock transaction. Due to the pending acquisition, Xilinx will not hold an earnings conference call or provide forwardlooking guidance. As permitted by the terms of the Merger Agreement between Xilinx and AMD, the Xilinx Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of 0.37 per outstanding share of common stock. The dividend is conditioned upon and will only be payable if the merger has not closed on or before the record date for such dividend. Xilinxs stock repurchase program remains suspended. As previously announced, the parties believe that the transaction will close in the first quarter of 2022. NonGAAP Financial Information Fiscal third quarter 2022 results include financial measures which are not determined in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP, as indicated. NonGAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of nonGAAP financial measures has been reconciled, in each case, to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, as indicated in the accompanying tables. Xilinxs the Company calculation of such nonGAAP measures may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures used by other companies. Management uses the nonGAAP financial measures disclosed herein, other than free cash flow, to evaluate the Companys financial results from continuing operations excluding the impact of acquisitions and compare to operating performance in past periods. Similarly, Management believes presentation of these nonGAAP measures is useful to investors because it enables investors and analysts to evaluate operating expenses of the Companys core business, excluding the impact of noncore business expenses, such as acquisitionrelated amortization and nonrecurring items, as described below: MA related expenses : These expenses mainly consist of legal, advisory and consulting fees associated with acquisition activities, and also include fees and retention compensation related to the Companys acquisition by AMD. The Company believes these costs do not reflect its current operating performance. Amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles : Amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology acquired in connection with business combinations. The nonGAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of the Companys current operating performance and comparisons to its past operating performance. Income taxes: The Company excludes the income tax effects of nonGAAP adjustments reflected in operating expenses and other income, as detailed above. It also excludes other significant tax effects of postacquisition tax integration transactions. The Company believes excluding postacquisition tax integration items will facilitate a comparable evaluation of its current performance to its past performance. In addition, free cash flow, which is cash flow from operations adjusted to exclude additions to software, property, plant, and equipment, is used by management when assessing the Companys sources of liquidity, capital resources, and quality of earnings. The Company believes that this nonGAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding the Companys capital requirements and provides an additional means to evaluate the cash flow trends of the Companys business. https:www.xilinx.comnewspress2022xilinxreportsrecordrevenueof101billioninfiscalthirdquarter.html Link to PDF\",\n          \"Corporate Participants Daniel Althoff Atlas Copco AB VP of IR Geert Follens Atlas Copco AB Senior EVP Business Area President of Vacuum Technique Henrik Elmin Atlas Copco AB Senior EVP Business Area President of Industrial Technique Mats Rahmstrm Atlas Copco AB President, CEO Director Peter Kinnart Atlas Copco AB Senior VP CFO Conference Call Participants Anders Idborg ABG Sundal Collier Holding ASA, Research Division Analyst Bertie Thomson Daniela C.

Also, a warm welcome to all of you joining us through the webcast. And before we start, as always, a bit of safety. In case of fire, inaudible will be located in the building and where it all started. And we will be informed if we need to evacuate. If so, please use any of the marked emergency exits. You see it on the map. And then go down to the main reception and we will meet outside the building on the parking lot back of the main reception. This is what were going to do today. We will have two presentations before we have a short break. Of course, coffee will be served. And after the break, we will have one more presentation and then a QA session. And during this QA, you will have the opportunity to ask your questions to Mats, Peter, Geert Get and Henrik. And for those of you joining us, via the web, you will have the opportunity to send in your questions through the player. We will pick them up and respond. After lunch, maybe more important, then we will bring it to the Atlas Copco Group Center for an innovation tool. But we will show you some tangible examples how we create value for our customers with our products and solutions. We will inaudible group at a Group Center. So some logistics before we kick off. Please make sure those of you who stayed at the hotel that you have checked out, and if you havent done that yet, please do it during the break because the buses, there will be three buses leaving this building outside the main reception at 1:00 sharp. Please make sure you catch the buses. We will end at around 5:00 at Atlas Copco Group Center. So with those words, I hand over to our President and CEO, Mats Rahmstrm. Welcome, Mats. MATS RAHMSTRM, PRESIDENT, CEO DIRECTOR, ATLAS COPCO AB: Thank you, Daniel. What the luxury to have you all here actually and to speak about our favorite topic, Atlas Copco for a full day. We will try to make it very interesting, I hope and also looking into the future as well. And I think Atlas Copco is a little bit on the move when it comes to being an Atlas Copco an industrial company to become more of an Atlas Copco technology company. And you can see that its more software, its more advanced applications that we do and actually less competition in the areas where we move to. And therefore, were going to give you a deep dive into Vacuum Technologies. Youre going to get your hands on this afternoon as well and Industrial Technologies as well. The downside of that is that there will be very limited information about the Compressor Technique and Power Technique this time. But Daniel is always available if you would like to have more questions around that. And then we will show how important to believe sustainabilities for Atlas Copcos future. Its probably our biggest opportunity. We start with the performance review where are we presently. The blue bars are revenue. And as you can see that we inaudible in quite a good order. And me and my teams target is to reach 8 growth over a business cycle. And adjusted for currency, which actually takes the number down a little bit, we are right on that target for this time period, its actually 8. And then we are proud to say that we try to protect our bottom line. And you can see that the operating margin is the red line there. And even in 2020, you can see its quite a small drop. So we are proud of the setup we have to be both agile and resilient to changes in the economy. Although I would say that we are willing to take bigger bets on innovation and organic growth, we have increased the spend in RD from 2.5 to 4. And that, you can see a seed capital to position ourselves not only for sustainability but also making the company future proof. And we focus every project on the value creation for our customers that ends up with our shareholders at the end of the day as well. This is that were going to have a high return on capital employed. Thats the yellow line. You can see its hovering around 30. And of course, thats due to when we acquire some bigger companies as well. And then if we look at the recent performance, we have had three fantastic quarters this year in Q3. We had Compressor Technique, they were up 21 organically Industrial Technique, 21 up Power Technique, 16 up. So very strong performance. And the downside was vacuum mainly linked to semis and that also linked to investments in memory. Then Im on the revenues, youre up 18. Its still very difficult with the supply chains. It hasnt changed in this quarter either. But at least sequentially, you can see that we have done fairly well if you look at the bars and a credit to the team that is working really hard on making this happen. Operating profit, SEK 8.4 billion, which is a record for Atlas Copco that was a margin of 22 and a 40 increase versus last year. And in the middle of Q4 now, I can confirm the outlook as well as we stated update. If you look geographically, we have worked hard over many years to be strong in all these regions to give the resilience to the group. And you can see that growth, it was actually so this is where we have the majority of our semi sales and all the other inaudible close to doubledigit growth for this quarter as well. Americas a little bit similar, but up 16, where we see signs of slowdown and maybe that would be Europe, even though in the quarter, it was still 10. We are building, what we call power hubs around the world right now. And its due to that we see even if we believe in free trade, we see protectionist. We have seen the result of corona, were a number of years now. So you can also see this as three power hubs. If you look at Vacuum Technologies, with the head office and manufacturing in U.K., they are extending their presence in Japan, Korea and in China. And recently, also announced that they build a factory in the U.S. as well to take care of all these new industries. Compressor Technique, same thing there. We have a strong presence in Asia, have a strong presence in North America, and in Europe. So that is good as well. Power Technique saying well, they are in Asia, in China, in Rock Hill in the U.S. and a very strong base there. Industrial Technique with the smaller tools, we have a European. But what they do instead is that they set up customer centers with very close project management. So everything surrounding the tools and automation is done more and more locally as well. And you can say that we do these power hubs to protect ourselves from protectionist, principally. But it will take some time, but we are in quite a good position already today. Our targets just confirm on the 8 growth target over business cycle, high return on capital employed and cash dividend at around 50 of the annual profit. And then the nonfinancial targets, we have strengthened that. Its in all 18 targets, and you can read more about that in the annual report. The one thing that I wanted to elaborate a little bit more on was the scientificbased targets. We not only signed up for scientificbased targets, we created plans to meet the targets as well. And I think thats a huge difference. Its easy to sign up. Its very much more difficult to deliver on those targets. But for Scope 1, Scope 2, which is our own operation. We have said that were going to target a 1.5 degree that 46 reduction. And Im 100 committed that we will make that happen. Then we have Scope 3, which is the usage of our products, and then we are giving ourselves the target to well below 2 degrees. We are committed to deliver the most energyefficient product. We are committed to change what we have from fossil to electric. We are committed to work with the product mix that we sell but we will not be able to do this on our own. We need to see that we get renewables in the grids around the world as well. And that is not happening in the pace that we need to right now. If you look at the trends, as we see them at least, digitalization might not be so new, but its a fantastic driver for Vacuum Technologies. And I normally get the question, are we an end of the cycle of investments and so on? And of course, these investments in semi is a little bit up and down, which we have seen from history. But I would still claim that we are in the beginning of something. Its not the end of anything when it comes to that. If you see the changes in society, the way I look at you, how you do your report, how you gather, transport, evaluate data, its just increasing. So its a very good spot to be in. We also use digitalization for our service businesses, more and more products are connected. I would say that more than 200,000 compressors, Power Technique is getting up a bit 20,000 compressors also connected today, 100 of the electric tools in Industrial Technique is connected as well. So we really use that as well and the usage for our own operation as well. Another concept that we are exploring to see where we will end up is that the digital twin of our products has always been present in RD. But we are trying to explore what we can do with the digital twin in the sales process. It will be extremely interesting to run a virtual compressor versus competition, for example, to be able to say, well, this is the efficiency, this is how it will run in your environment. And of course, we use it as well in service then to be able to predict what will happen. So for us, digitalization is very positive. The second I brought up is automation. And you can see on the inaudible, its onshoring. Now its real, its been talked about for quite some time with the new U.S., the Ship Act and the Inflation Act and whatever its called. We can see that bringing home business. You can also see that from a labor competence that they need to do it to automate and also from efficiencies point. And the link for us here is a lot about the vision technologies. That we can show and we can replace then the human being eyes with different vision applications. So for us, we see this as a great benefit. And arm tooling, we normally talk about. Thats everything that is at the end of a robot. And this is a new application for compressor technique, when many of the grippers are actually pneumatic today or it could be a vacuum application. So two other business areas getting involved in the automation process. Low carbon society. I think many believe its a threat, we do not believe that at all. We think its the biggest opportunity for Atlas Copco, and I will talk a little bit later about that as well. We were not sure about the wording deglobalization, but I hope its okay. We believe in free trade, but we need to act according to how the world is really developing, and thats why were building these three power hubs to be protected from protectionist. If you look at our strategy, what we do when we spend quite a lot of time on selecting segments where we like to build the business organically and also when we do acquisitions. And what were looking for is trying to find a position where we can be 1 or 2. We need innovation, we need a differentiated technology. And the only one that determines if we have that is the customer to say, well, this is value creating for us. And then we prefer something that is critical to the customers process. And the only reason for that if its critical to their process, you talk about value, if its a commodity, you talk about price. And we are not so good talking about price. We prefer to be in the premium segment. And of course, the resilience from a leading service offer is also give that stickiness to our customer to be back and talk to them. And then we have five pillars for the growth rate and the spend probably much more time on people management than you think. And inaudible is here, you can talk to her as well. But we spend a lot of time finding people that fits into a decentralized organization. And then we spend a lot of time on the internal job market to make people move up in the system. We spend enormous time on education for people that has the drive and passion to move up in the organization. And as you know, we have a lot of people that stay for many years in Atlas Copco. The second pillar I also think the extremely important. Also people driven to find those people that has that entrepreneurial spirit and drive innovation for us. Then we have presence geographically to get the resilience. We have the service offer as this gap. Operational is another topic that we actually spent quite a lot on time on. And if you ever have the opportunity to be see Compressor Technique, they are expert at driving out cost out of the processes. At the same time, wed like to give our customers a unique product for exactly what they need, but we try to build it in modules to make it efficient for us. So thats the way we go forward. And at the end of the day, we want to be diversified, agile and resilient business model. And being resilient, one of the things we just listed the customers up there. So we have a broad number of customers, probably compressors is in most of them, Vacuum Technologies is most on the Industrial Technique is in most of them. So we can see that. And we are not really dependent on one segment. You can see that Henrik and Industrial Technique then theyre in the automotive, but thats also compressors and everything else in automotive, but its still limited to 9 of the group. And if you look at semi, we talk a lot about semi in every quarterly report. But electronics there, where its part of its less than also that its a one digit on semis as well. So we have a very broad base of customers to work with. Then we put in a lot of effort to build our service to get that resilience, the stickiness to our customers, and its not only that. We also with every service contract, we get happier and more pleased customers. And I think they secured the next order for us many times. So very much OpEx driven, of course, an equipment CapEx driven. And we have a strong presence then in a number of segments, as you can see. The organization, I guess, we are recognized for the decentralized way we are working. And we all will need to give people a real job is with real accountability but also authority to act. So if you look at the four business areas, its actually only eight people that work in the business areas. And 97 of the people work in the line, which is, I think, astonishing, and every division has the highest operational responsibility. They have a full value chain to be responsible for. And what we drive is not only the knowledge about our products, its the knowledge about our customers application and if there is another way to do this. And then you can see that we take decisions in this way and then you might say, well, they dont take advantage of the synergies. We do. And then we call it counsel and that goes this way in our organization. So we have a purchase council. Its not that you need to follow the recommendation there, but you get everything. These are good suppliers. This is how we work with them. If you take logistics, in Belgium, we have the Vacuum Technique, Industrial Technique and Power Technique sharing the same distribution center. We say its not an order winner where it comes from, if it works, it works. So we do take advantage of the synergies in our organization as well. The other thing that we think its fairly easy. If you look at vacuum technologies, it started out as a division big enough and then it becomes a business size. Its a very scalable model for us. So its fairly easy to add different opportunities. Vision technology became its own division as well, for example. We are proud to be we just showed in the first picture when we look at the profitability, both agile and resilient to changes in the market conditions. And there are a number of things we do. First, I already show we have presence in many, many segments. We have a strong geographical coverage that has been tremendously beneficial many times. Service is 35 of what we do. When we manufacture, we do 25 of the components ourselves. We do the final assembly and the quality test, but we share the responsibility of the components around 70, 75 of the components are actually sourced to help our balance sheet in things like this. Then we work with temporary workforce. Right now, we are running flat out. But in a normal condition, of course, we work with temporary and its normally slightly higher where we have more flexibility like in semi and around 10 in other business areas. And then every division is responsible to have a scenario planning, which is normally a scenario of 10 down, 20 down, 10 up, 20 up. And then of course, we and its more to be quick to act that we find important. The other thing that we do is added this little green dot here that out of a slowdown, many times, we become a stronger company, and I think thats what we have seen in the last 1.5 years. Already here, when we went into the corona, we said thats, okay, we are not going to touch strategic RD. Lets keep that. We are not going to attach the investments we do in digitalization. Were not going to change the competence. So those are the three areas where we kept. And then we were really tough on all other costs. But as you can see, the then we getting out of this, we normally have an opportunity to launch a new generation of products and have the competence that. Innovation, without innovation, without creating the value for customers, then we would not be successful. So for us to become arrogant or anything around innovation, its not an opportunity. We really need to drive this constantly. And its also probably the most valuable activity we can help to create value for our shareholders. So we have increased from at 2.5 to 4 over the years. So you can see its quite rapid. And the outcome of that is, of course, what you see in the sales numbers, but also that we are launching more products than we ever have in the past. And when we look at the success rate of new products, its really, really good. And why is it good? Its because we have so close links to customers today to understand the applications. And if we only understood our own products, I think we would fail from time to time, we have done in the past, but a very close connection to the big semis, the big autos, the big aerospace customer to exactly identify what and how they will build the next generation of products. And this is also part of transforming the market. And sometimes, I know that we are asked, well, how big is this market? And we say, well, normally, when you look at the market like this, which is our sales in blue than and competing sales in gray, we are not always interested in all the gray parts. Were trying to find the niches where we can make good money where its really adding value to our customers. And normally, if you go after a piece of the gray, you go up headtohead with competition and price becomes a more important factor. We do that as well, of course, but in every product we do, were also trying to find that leverage to transform the market to some sort of new technology. And then your if you go for this piece, its normally that youre competing as much directly versus competition, youre competing versus another process. And then youre talking value instead of price because no one have been there to set the price of that product yet. And that it could be that when we went from pneumatic to electric, 98 of what we sell to the car industry today is electric smart tools, nor the value generation for us, its huge because these tools are significantly more expensive, but gives even more view. Event from diesel to electric will portables. So thats available as an electric product as well, more content for us, a higher price, but also the benefit of low carbon. We can go from electric to battery. We went from fixedspeed compressors and fixedspeed vacuum pump to variable speed products, another thing to talk about another process, energy efficiency. And of course, uptime in service contract is much more value than the breakdown repairs as well. So just because we see that this part might not be of interest to us from a profit perspective, a transformed market might be very interesting for us. And were also trying to extend the offer that we have. And it could look something like this. I gave you a number of examples here. This is first on Compressor Technique. If you go filtration, we have done for many years to filters for compressor. Its very profitable. But then we said, well, this is a fantastic business. We hired walker filter. They are both in OEM and they also supply to us. And suddenly, we also have filters for the vacuum business and we get the range of industrial filters as well. So it gives us a new platform for growth, and we can also pick where we would like to be. And then might say, well, what is the total market for filter? Well, thats huge, but we have no interest in going into the auto market for filter. Its very competitive, blue margins. So we stay with the industrially filters where we have the access to the customers and its more valuable for our customers. We had temperature control or chillers is something else. We have just launched this year a couple of products from that acquisition under Atlas Copco name, still to be evaluated. Low pressure. We have been on that for a number of years, doubledigit growth for many years. Its part of the cleaning process of cleaning water. You have industrial gases. You know that most as you can see all these trucks driving around to deliver gas to hospitals and other industries from a sustainability point of view to have that logistics in sitting, oxygen, nitrogen generated themselves to manufacture their own gases. And this is what you have seen also, its developing extremely well for us under industrial air. And then high pressure is the links to hydrogen. And you can see that we have more projects in hydrogen than we thought a year ago. But of course, the commercialization of hydrogen might be a number of years ahead of us. So thats a number of new platforms for us. The cryogenic pumps is the linkage to the tool makers for semi. This is where we also sell the turbo pumps, very good acquisition. It had a bumpy start, but now its actually performing well above what we expected. Were getting into process diagnostics. Liquid ring pumps is kind of the base for industrial pumps and a base for transformation into something more advanced and gas were per delivery as well. Im happy that Geert is here to present later on, then you can ask all the question about this. Then in Industrial Technique, we have done, over the years, a lot on different assembly technologies. We are very good at dispense technologies for the auto sector but we have been eager to get into electronics, which is, of course, a growing segment as well. Scheugenpflug was an entry point to this, we have one or two technology there, but there are more technologies also for electronics dispensing. And that is also performing really well. And then we talked about the inline and machine vision, which is the ISRA acquisition. that open up the door for automation for us. So very, very interesting. And in we dont build boilers or anything in steam, but we are a packager of steam and we rent steam in our specialty rental division together with oilfree machines, Oxo become quite successful. And then the new area that is the industrial pumps, Same here. We are not interested in a complete pump market. Were not going to move water from one side to another. Its going to be some sort of critical. Its going to be dirty water in case or mainly its going to be industrial pumps, where pumps are actually critical to the process. And what they have in common is the characteristics that we spoke about before, interesting niche market, the standalone attractiveness is there, interesting service offer, it doesnt matter where you are in orientation, this is how we evaluate if these areas for 2022, sales would be around SEK 11 billion for this new segment. So its quite a big addition to what we have done in the past as well. And of course, the upside of these are probably greater than some of our more traditional technologies. We have done more acquisitions this year than ever before. You can see some of the characteristics that we are looking for. But we do we look at this in two ways. We have dedicated people to look at the different platforms. If you see the Wangen pump, Geveke and Lewa up there, this is the industrial pumper base that we now have to see how that and the start is really good there. Soft2Tec is aero proofing when you do assembly technologies, its vision technologies that help the operator to guide them to make sure that they tighten your car or refrigerator or bicycle or whatever it might be. SCB is the drain that we were sourcing before. Now we have our own technology. Oxymat is onsite here. So these are all new platforms where we have dedicated people, and we do normally a new business line. So we can see that how we report on this and then it could be become a division as well, of course, over time. And then we have the rollups and its riskfree almost then. We have acquired both vacuum technologies and compressor technique distributors over a number of years. And you might think that, well, then they are going to a new model or more direct sales, that is actually not correct. We are actually signing up more new distributors than we are acquiring. So that is not changing the way we go to market. But what happens here in the perfect word is that we find someone competing distributor. They have a great service business. They have a lot heating machines out in the region. We entered into this, we have access to part. We continue to service all competing machines, but stepbystep year after year, we replace all the machines in this territory. And of course, the upside is both on the service side and on the equipment side. And that model is fairly solid. And if we make a mistake, its more a people mistake than a business mistake. So the success rate is extremely high here, of course, and a low risk for us. And that means also that when you see, well, why do they do a small acquisition of 20 people in Canada or whatever it might be. But the value creation for our owners is fairly easy to calculate. We talked about service. We have six dedicated organizations for service. And the most might be that we get to see the customer more frequently and we will know when they have a problem, we will know when they have a new investment coming up. So it gives us that stickiness to the customers. From a resilience point of view, then its 35, as I mentioned before. And I must say that the focus that we have, you can say, why dont you have one sort of organization? Well, they really understand and know the customer. So really focus beat synergies. So we dont mix. These are dedicated people for dedicated customers. Then we do transactional Net Promoter Scores for the service contracts and all our customers. And we can see that not only is it profitable for us, it gives us the stickiness, but it also makes our customers more pleased with the product and the service they get. So its actually a winwin there as well. And here, you can see that. You can see that when we benchmark then, this is not FX adjusted. Thats why a little bit higher in my first number. You can see the 11 here and the CAGR on equipment is 9. So over this period of time, and you can see also that they are keeping up even though CapEx equipment sales have been fantastic over a number of years, you can see theyre keeping up as well. And remarkable enough, you remember 2020 here, when we couldnt get access to customers. For the full year, service sales was only down 3. Switching gears a little bit, talk about sustainability. And first, I will show a short video, so you get to meet some of my management team here as well and see how they put in their efforts here. presentation MATS RAHMSTRM: We are actually really on top of this, both for our own operations as you can see on this slide then, and the commitment to sciencebased targets. In our Scope 1 and Scope 2, you can see its very small out of this complete CO2 footprint. And we really work hard with our customers to see if we can get up to renewable energy reduction then until 2030. And Im really, really sure we can make that. So its really good. And then on the other side, we can work and we have given a demand to every division that we should offer the most energyefficient products out there. We will work with our mix. So we actually sell the more energyefficient product that will be beneficial for our teams to do that. I would say that we are almost there. You can see 87 of our products are already electric. You can say, well, to make it easy for us that we can say, well, if you only use renewable, it would not be a problem, but we dont make that shortcut. We make the challenge to ourselves as well to fix this. And on the diesel part, its the portable compressors. You actually see a small piece of it there. So what we have done there is that we went to buy a diesel first for lab testing, and you can run the engines on that. But now we also offer a completely electric one. And they are really common in demand as well this year. So we can see a lot of good sales numbers for that as well. And if you can make it electric, you could also think that you can do it with batteries if you want to. The other part, which we will take away is the Abatement System that is in semiconductors and in vacuum applications. We have fossil fuel, but we also have electric building a new range for electric as well. So we can also replace them as efficient or better than the fossil fuel ones. The only piece that will be left here is the generators for a logical reason, its difficult to take away when youre actually trying to create them, the end product is electricity. So its been a very, very small part, but maybe its also good to remember that the company is already electrified. This is a very interesting slide because now we talked a little bit how were going to do that. Now go into the more of the business opportunity. So a few years ago, we were a little bit what does this mean to Atlas Copco, can be many engineers and how do we view this? And what can happen? And what is the potential for this? And how do we take advantage of this change? And then we asked, in this case, McKinsey, which is a so if you use Europe as a base 2050, and Im sure you recognize a lot of them. First one is onshore wind, then you have solar, battery cars, heat pumps, you have battery heavy transport, transport and you have wind again, fossilfree steel, carbon capture and the 1 biofuels is over here as well. And then we think, okay, now we know this. This is how it will look like. This is what will be needed for the future. but how could we present that to our team to get them engaged and understand how this society looks like and say, can we not paint a picture of society with this new. And this is our best attempt so far how this new world would look like. And of course, in transport sector, if you start there, you can say the cars. Its approximately 13 of sales globally today. But when Henrik talks later about his sales numbers, the lions share of his auto CapEx goes into battery or hybrids today. So its really changing in that way. And the other thing, the number of battery factories that we are working to known. Its the new engine. And for us, the potential is higher with the battery car than it was with a fossildriven car. So from that perspective, its very interesting. If you go down further to the truck over here, then of course, you talk about battery, which we know will be the most efficient, but they also discuss hydrogen. And of course, hydrogen then you enter into the highpressure compressors and it was also mentioned in its industrial application, but also the mobile application where you actually fill up on hydrogen. So that could be of interest as well. This is probably just the cruiser in between. And you can already today in inaudible battery ferries, the battery application is interesting. But if this was where we get a lot of business this transport and, of course, you need to compress gases you need to take care of it when you transport and expand gases. Its fantastic applications for compressor technique there as well. Clean water, its a scarce resource in many areas of the world. And low pressure is part of that from Compressor Technique, but those have been new acquisition from Wangen pumps, they take care of the debris from this and into biogas applications. So thats another two applications where we see interest. Solar, as you know, most of these companies are Chinese today, but we can also see with Inflation Act, its called IRA. I dont think its a good name, but thats what its called. You can see that there will be focused on this in the U.S. as well to try to be competitive here. And there you have application for vision and you also have applications for vacuum. From this factory, we offer today heat recovery application. Of course, its not been so efficient. But with the energy prices as they are and they want to be CO2 neutral, of course, heat recovery application will be of great interest and its a compressor application. Its also carbon capture. We do carbon capture solution in gas and process today for our customers. Wind turbines, Industrial Technique is part of the assembly from an industrial point of view. But this afternoon, you will also see how we engaged now in actually building these towers. And then Compressor Techniques help up with around workplace here, they can put a bubble curtain to protect sea life as well. So thats another application there. And, of course, everything on this is connected and digital, which is then very beneficial for our Vacuum Technique business. And then what is the full potential of this, we dont know. But we know its significant. I asked Vagner Rego the other day because we do business view for 2023. And I said we looked at all his applications. I say, what do you think the market for compressors will be in a few years. And then he said, well, if this hydrogen really happens, if the energy storage happens, if the natural gas will happen, he said, well, I think the market for compressor can be twice the size as it is today. And Im not making a claim that we knew that. Im just saying that compressor that some people might think are old technologies is really a neighbor for this type of society we are looking for. So you will not be able to get there without compressing gases, moving gases, expanding gases. So we think its Daniel asked me before he says, which is your favorite picture he said, when I said, well, this is the one for my presentation. And I think its the one to remember if youre interested in Atlas Copcos future as well. Short term, we said that will a little bit on the other businesses as well. This is then Compressor Technique, really, really strong performance over 3 quarters, very well positioned for this carbon as we just discussed. Steady margins, 21 growth, 24 above operating margin. And you can also see that even though theyre extremely successful with the service business, you can see that they are keeping up. So CAGR for service has been 8 and equipment 5. But what is this CAGR? Well, is actually, you can see it was very flat the first 5 years, and then it seems like we have found a new path here with group, and thats really linked to what we talked about earlier to invest more in RD as well. And then I couldnt keep this from you. I will show you another video. And I thought that would be funny to say, well, this is the Ferrari of the compressor world. But then I realized that this product is much better than Ferrari. Its actually its electric. Its not fossil fuel. Its energy efficient. It has connectivity. I dont know if Ferraris are connected or not, and its built with modularity. So when you look at this video, this is the first or the nextgeneration VSD compressor, its the first one in a new range of products. But you just see how clean it is and what we speak about, I think its a fantastic product that will completely outperform competition. presentation MATS RAHMSTRM: So I worked 34 years in this company. And I think every year, the RD team have said, well, now we are really pushing the limit for innovation. We cannot do anything more, and then they bring something like this again. Its unbelievable. Theres a lot of talent in that team. Power Technique, you can see here as well that they have the one thing that weve done really well is the specialty rental, not only the oil free, but acquisition two acquisitions were done in steam has been extremely successful as well. That goes as a service division in our case. But thats really moving the needle, and its also very profitable for us. In portables, you can see then that we did the diesel to electric, which is also going along and there we are clearly 1 in what we do. And then I think one of the more interesting part is the entry into industrial pumps with the two acquisitions with a good start, but we are still a small niche players. But the technologies that we now control, we do really well, but theres an obvious case, of course, to see if we can add on more technologies to that as well. Financially, theyre performing on another level right now. Im not saying its sustainable as we had it in the 18.9, but its significantly better than where we had ever been before. And one of the areas where we were strong a little bit of profitability, also it is generator, but also now that is really picking up. And now we are combining generators with energy storage, which looks very interesting for construction sites as well that many of the construction site like to drive the CO2 levels down as well. So that looks very positive as well. And then service is difficult in power because the equipment are moving around all the way but it seems like you have found an extra gear there as well. And service is also performing really well. That is also including then the rental piece. And I wanted to give a short video, just 2 minutes on the industrial pump. So it gives you a little the pictures will give you a view of what kind of pumps this is. presentation MATS RAHMSTRM: There is, of course, a huge business for this, but when we talk about the characteristics we are interesting, okay, we want to be a niche player where its profitable, so its not all. And we also say that we like to see an interesting service business. And of course, this pump is critical process in industrial application. And its not so interesting if you just transport clean water or something that is very clean. Then you dont have so much service opportunities. But if you have chemicals, it can be due, it could be color. It could be a lot of different things that actually makes the service interesting very much in this area as well. And by that, I end my first part and welcome Peter Kinnart, our CFO, to stage. PETER KINNART, SENIOR VP CFO, ATLAS COPCO AB: Thank you, Mats, and welcome, everybody. That was a really very good overview of the Atlas Copco strategy and the Atlas Copco business model. Most of you that have been following us for quite a number of years are, of course, very familiar with our decentralized setup, the agility and resilience of our assetlight operations, et cetera. But looking at this presentation, what personally pleases me, even makes me proud as an employee of this company is the fact that to the power of innovation, our very competent and committed people and the continuous selective growth, both organically as well as inorganically. We are able to play a real role of significance in this race to net zero. And of course, our sciencebased targets are the KPI that we will use to measure our progress against that. But stepping aside a little bit from this very new and very important KPI, I would like to zoom in, together with you a little bit. And at the risk of being maybe a little bit both, this is, of course, a little bit of a repeat of what Mats has been talking about already before. But what is the main message I would like to bring here, nothing has changed. We still believe that these three very important longterm KPIs are the fundamental way of keeping track of our performance in Atlas Copco. It starts, of course, with the 8 average growth per year over a business cycle, a sustained high return on our capital employed. And last, but not least, a stable, growing and predictable cash return for our shareholders of approximately 50 of our net earnings. But we are not just looking for any kind of growth. For us, its very important that we are able to also deliver on our capital employed. Looking at the longterm growth, we will see here a picture of how the revenues have developed over time. And of course, it fluctuates a bit from 1 year to the other. But overall, exactly around this particular period of time, 2012 to 2021, we have reached exactly the 8 target that we are committed to deliver. As I mentioned, it is not just any kind of growth that we are looking for. And we want to make sure that the performance that we have been delivering over the years can be repeated time after time. In other words, that the growth gives us also a sustainable and high return. And of course, our business model with the 23 division, decentralized organization, the agile setup that we have and the resilience to our service organization is, of course, the foundation to be able to deliver this continued high return on capital employed. This, you could say, is our formula for value creation. The high return on capital employed is not only built on a lean and agile balance sheet, but also on a very solid operating profit performance. And if you look a little bit at this particular slide, showing the earnings per share over a longer period of time, then you can also see that the importance of the operating profitability performance, it has gradually over time, taken an even more important role, growing from 72 of the earnings per share to 78 of the earnings per share. And in fact, the impact of our net financial costs and the income tax on our operations is not having is not so big. And of course, we could say that our tax and treasury team is also running a very tight ship while the bulk of the responsibility to generate this profitability comes, of course, from our operations. They are really doing the job. Now moving a little bit from profitability to cash generation. And this slide for me personally, is a very important slide, but because it is almost a perfect illustration of our agile and resilient business model. First of all, it shows the impact of the growth of the business over time and the consequent profitability, but also that if at times when we are maybe not able due to all kinds of reasons and circumstances to increase the profitability as we would like. And even though this has been seldom the case, we are always able to then at least grow the cash flow. At the bottom of this scorecard, you can also see the modest investments that are required to feed the growth to produce this growing profit and growing cash flow over time. Even though we have been indicating over the last several quarters that we are making very significant capacity investments and that you can see in the last gray bar at the box. So conclude that in the bigger scheme of things, these investments are not really very heavily affecting cash flow nor the profitability over time, but they are extremely necessary to be able to feed the future growth looking at all of these fantastic new applications that are opening up for all of our business areas. And in this picture, you can also clearly see how we continue to be an assetlight operation. We have, of course, invested heavily. We also see that we have had some issues over the last several quarters when it comes to inventory buildup due to all the supply chain issues that we have been facing. And we have also mentioned the extensive investment programs that we are pushing out to increase the capacity to deliver all these orders on hand. But if we put a little bit in perspective against the revenue development, then you can also see that over a longer perspective, it is not really a material change. And as the revenues will continue to grow based on our annual growth target, there is even room for more for the future. And then finally, we have, of course, the ambition to give to our shareholders a stable, growing and predictable cash return. And I believe when we look at this particular picture, it is fair to say that we have been able to deliver on that promise as well. We have also added here in this slide, the additional cash distributions through the mandatory share redemptions, as you can see. But overall, when it comes to the cash distribution, I think it is clear that we are also here demonstrating a high resilience over a longer period of time. As the dividend over this entire period has never ever dropped and, in fact, has even grown every single year over this period. So with that, I would like to conclude a short recap of our key financial longterm targets and a review of the Atlas Copcos longterm performance track record. But before going into another deep dive into two of our business areas, I would like to hand back to Mats for a short summary. MATS RAHMSTRM: Thank you, Peter. So final slide, we try to summarize this. What we try to give to our owners, what we are working hard for every day, its to give a diverse business. And as we have proven in the presentation, geographic spread, spread by segment as well to minimize risk. We talk about being a market leader is always important for us to be 1 and 2. If you look at Compressor Technique, I believe that you can say that they are twice the size of closest competitor at this point. If you go to Vacuum Technique in semiconductors, they are clearly 1, an industrial vacuum, we said before that we were 2 or 3. And today, when we look at the quarterly reports, we can see that we are also 1 in Industrial and Scientific. In Industrial Technique, we are not only 1 in these technologies with our second brand, were actually 2 in the world as well. And we see with entering into flexible automation that Henrik will talk about. In Power Technique, with portable compressors, we are 1. In generators, we are probably 1 in one region of the world and maybe 3 in other parts of the world, so we have some work to do. And of course, we just entered into the industrial pumps. Big commitment to innovation, sustainability from our side, which you can see in the increase that we have had in RD and the number of products that we launch and the commitment to the sciencebased targets. To get the resilience, to get the stickiness with customers, we should have the best service offer. And as you can see, its appreciated by customers. Its growing faster than equipment sales as well. The organization is decentralized, give people a lot of responsibility. Its really light when it comes to stab functions and all the resources are close to customers. And its a very scalable organization. And as Peter has shown them that we are trying to be very asset light in the way we set up our operation to be able to be agile for different conditions in the marketplace. And of course, as I showed in my favorite picture, a really enabler for a sustainable society. Thank you so much. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Thank you, Mats. So Geert Follens. GEERT FOLLENS, SENIOR EVP BUSINESS AREA PRESIDENT OF VACUUM TECHNIQUE, ATLAS COPCO AB: Good morning, and its a pleasure to be here and to have this opportunity to explain to you how and what were doing in Vacuum Technique. I also look forward to later this morning and this afternoon to be able to interact with you and at least to try to answer all your questions. So what Im going to cover in this presentation is facts. So indeed, how are we doing. Talk a bit about the market and the fundamentals, which is a little bit changing today, strategy for growth, that will be most of the time and then closing with what are we doing for or getting to a low carbon society. So looking at the facts. And if I go through the trends and the drivers first, as you know, the majority of our business is still semiconductor. And within semiconductor, we see this continuous strength to make smaller and smaller chips. You can say 7nanometer is now the standard. 5nanometer is there already, and we are working towards or our customers are working towards 3, even 1.5nanometer. Second trend is the machinedriven data generation, where there was a time where semiconductor was driven by personal computers, tablets and phones. This has now changed completely into a machinedriven application. And as you know, theres many more machines than people and they all have some kind of electronics within them. The traditional ones, 5G, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, automotive healthcare are growing very fast and everything is interconnected now. Every device is talking to another device. And also very important, legislation is becoming more and more important within the semiconductor and what you can exhaust from the customers processes. Then within industrial, scientific vacuum, we are getting bigger and bigger in the food industry. Regulations also there are getting more stringent. So that drives our business. Batteries, we talk a lot about batteries, but then the production of the battery cells, theres four processes where you need vacuum. Its the coating, its the drying, its the filling and the gassing. So batteries is a very, very important part for our Industrial business. Solar is very obvious, and space, more and more satellites out there. They ought to be tested in a vacuum environment. The common trends that are valid for both are clearly sustainability. So we are working very hard to have more energyefficient products and where we focused in the past and still very much on total cost of ownership. Now we see that drive from all our customers and the questions towards more sustainability, a sustainable solution. Service uptime, we are there now. So all the machines are interconnected, and its about yields and uptime through connectivity. And for us, very important, we are kind of in the eye of the storm is geopolitics where there is more and more a trend for local for local rather than having all the business in one part of the world. So these are the trends and the drivers. If I look to the left to the graph, Im proud to say that we had 8 consecutive quarters of revenue growth. And if you look on the graph, in 2019, we were at SEK 5 billion and now were at SEK 11 billion in revenue. In quarter 3, for the first time, we passed the 1 billion mark in revenue, which is a nice milestone for us. You can see the orders, of course, since early 2020. Orders have been much bigger than the revenue. We did not see a slowdown in 2020 because of COVID because we have work from home that created a lot of business, mainly in the semiconductor industry. And you can see the buildup of our order book during the quarters. This quarter or the last quarter, quarter 3 was the first quarter where we invoiced more than we received, so we start to eat slowly into the order book. From a profitability point of view, in quarter 3, we were at 23, which equals 24.6 EBITDA, a bit higher than quarter 1 and quarter 2. Profitability is influenced by problems or instability in the supply chain. Our return on capital employed, 25. You know we have kind of a heavy balance sheet because of the acquisitions of Edwards, Leybold, CSK and the cryo pumps, but still we achieved to do 25 on return on capital employed. So looking at our current performance. You see a lot of minus signs on there. To be fair, I must say that September 21, was the first quarter of extremely high orders. So we are going down now in every continent. This is purely driven by semiconductor. Our general vacuum business, so Industrial Scientific Vacuum is growing very nicely, and our aftermarket is growing very nicely. But the two semiconductor product divisions are coming down for the moment. Theres a couple of drivers there. And you all know about the memory, the inventory to billings have been has been going up for a while. So there is a bit of a hold back now on memory investments. There have been some delays in the construction of the new fabs. We see that in the construction of our own factories as well. And there is a general atmosphere of worsening business climate, which takes it all down a little bit. Of course, part of the big increase weve seen in the last quarter is also because our lead times were going up and then the customer is ordering a bit earlier. Now that we start to invoice more than we receive, we will see the opposite effects. So that plays some role in this. Asia is going down more than Europe and the Americas. And thats mainly because the main memory players are in Asia. So you have Micron, you have Hynix and you have Samsung, and they have most of their production in Asia. So that explains the stronger drop in Asia still, of course, we have 56 in that part of the world. So the markets we operate in, I said that 65 is electronics. And now its all about data and interconnectivity in the machines. Every appliance you buy now has electronics. So the whole digitalization process is helping us there. Another important part we are seeing is the revival of the 200millimeter fabs. There was a time that we said 200millimeter fabs will disappear. But now that is coming back very strongly, partly because of the capacity problems in semi, but also the highperforming power electronics are often on a 200millimeter fab, silicon carbide or silicon. But still, this is coming back and for us, showing nice growth. Processes are getting harsher, when I said you go now to 5, 3nanometers, that means its tougher to make these chips and for us, theres much more corrosive components and rare elements being used, and we all have to get that through the vacuum pumps. And what we clearly saw, and Ill come back to that later, is that capacity and agility is driving share. With the boom we have seen if you could deliver, you could take the business and thats an important driver for us. Within process, the second biggest part of our business, we take increasing share foods. I said already, more regulations chemical, pharma, metallurgy. So the steel business has grown quite a lot for us as well. And then Foods, were getting more and more share in the food industry with all different applications, you can see there. Then general manufacturing, the third part is Mats mentioned it already. We are proud to say that we are now also in our industrial area, the 1 with all our brands together. We continue to drive wettodry transition. It helps the sustainability and it helps for us to create value for the customer. And two new areas where were focusing on now is the liquid ring pumps and the mobile vacuum. And then a few other growing segments, I must say, is solar, of course, very much today in China, but with the IRA also moving west. And then coating and so glass coating and also, I could have mentioned the space in there. So this is where we are. And in general, all these segments are showing nice progress. So then not to answer your questions, but to look back on how has the semiconductor business developed over the years. And this is a graph showing from 1987 to this year, to 2022, how the IC business, the semiconductor business revenue has developed. And this is a full 35 years of 10 CAGR. So this is what were dealing with. And you can see, if you go further back, there were quite some big swings in there. We are in that business since 2013. We have seen a slight dip in 15, a little bit more in 19. But if you look at the longer trends, this is very positive. And then the righthand picture is that the first part of the graph up to the SEK 600 billion is the same. The forecast is that by 2030, that business will grow to 1 trillion. So you can see the there is some acceleration even in the growth of the semiconductor business. So I think these are very nice, very nice picture and a very nice business to be in. So what is driving that? Of course, its AI. Its the 5G network. What we see is that the adoption of 5G has been much faster than the adoption of 4G. And the other thing you see is when you have 5G, when you have a faster network, you actually use it much more because its much more convenient to use it. So 6G is now in trial stage, I would say, but 5G is adapting very much. Cloud computing is driving it. You could say, is it cloud computing? Or is it edge computing? Thats just a matter where you compute and how you transfer the data, but cloud or edge is growing very good. Gaming is a bit down for the moment. It was very much in when COVID hits. Its now because of the general feeling of the industry is coming down a bit. Medical is basically exploding. Work from home again a bit down because people are coming back to the office. Supercomputing, Bitcoin, all the data analysis drives supercomputing. Ill talk a little bit about Quantum later on, but that could be the future for supercomputing. IoT. Automotive, we are only at the beginning of the chips in the car. There are already a lot, but now we are on assisted driving. If you would go to autonomous driving, this would be an explosion of the use of chips in the car. You have all the screens now in a car, which is driving our business as well. And then, of course, the interconnectivity of machines in industrial. So these are all individual areas that drive our business. But the important thing, if you think about it is that this is all about data. So data gets produced, then data get computed, data gets transferred and then data gets stored in whatever order you want to take it. So all of these are interconnected, and its all driving the chips industry forward. And thats why we are pretty confident that this will continue. Good. So that was a bit facts in the market. So what are we doing now to take our share of the growth in there. So I will talk about agility and capacity and how that drives our business. Innovation, very important pillar in everything we do. The opportunity in the U.S., you certainly have read and heard about the chips and acquisitions. General vacuum to try to explain how we gained the leadership position in their local for local, talk about service and then last but not least, people and culture. So this is what were doing for the moment from a capacity investment and to increase our agility. We often talk about agility downwards, but for us, actually agility upwards is even more important. Its about having the capacity to deal with increased demand. So in the past, we have invested an enormous amount in Asia, and you saw from the geographical distribution that, that is the biggest part. What we see now is that because of the CHIPS Act and whats going with all the geopolitical battles that are going on, that there is a lot of potential coming in America. And Ill show us a slide later on the different initiatives there. But were building four factories for the moment in U.S. still two in Korea, an extension in China, and we extend our factory our abatement factory in the U.K. With this, of course, with the supply chain that stabilizes, we will be able to take the business in an agility upwards situation. Then on innovation, why do we innovate? If you look at the nine box on the left, the traditional themes that we always have with innovation. Its about performance. Its about, of course, efficiency. We have our own electronic software and motor and converted development. We do a lot of simulation tools and you going up very strongly is how the circular economy and sustainability is driving the innovation and what were doing there. Its not just about energy efficiency. Its also about using more electricity instead of fuel and really develop the products for the circular economy, which you see clearly in our service business. Digital twins, it was mentioned already, it has been there in engineering for a long time, but now we adapt to twin so that they can also be used through the marketing through the manufacturing. So thats a big topic. And then we often talk about controlling the processes in the vacuum industry. Organically, we develop gauges. We develop traps and control systems to be more dominant in that part through innovation. So if you look at this picture, at the top, we have our four product divisions. And on the left, we develop, of course, to be better in our core business. We develop products for environmental digital to interact with our customers to interact with our machines, service to interact with the machines and new applications. So if I take a few as an example, within Industrial, we drive this wettodry. So we try as much as possible to replace an oilinjected vacuum pump with the dry vacuum pump. We have launched a lot of new cryo pumps since we acquired the business from Brooks a couple of years ago. So this is really strengthening our core position. Then from an environmental point of view, within semiconductor, we focus a lot, and you will see that this afternoon on the recycling recovery and recycling becomes very important. And then all the again, wettodry is a very environmental one on the scroll side. Digital to support our customers and our service business, as I mentioned. And then on new applications, if I take liquid ring as an example, we were very small and they have developed organically superefficient machines and are now taking share on that. And maybe as a last example, the Quantum where when you talk Quantum computers, you need extreme low temperatures, you need high vacuum and you need automation. So we are working together with universities and you will see in acquisitions later that this is a part where we are preparing to be ready when Quantum is coming to be an important supplier to that very interesting industry. I mentioned the CHIPS Act. This is a picture of the U.S. where you see all the fabs that have been announced to be built in the United States. So the CHIPS Act was approved in Congress, and you see all these. Some of our announcements like Micron, both in, in Boise and in New York State. Others like TSMC are already there. They have some delay in construction. They are working on the pilot lines and are building it. Also, Intel in Arizona is building. So really a very dynamic picture. It says its a matter of national security, but its basically geopolitically that everybody wants to make the chips because they are a strategic project in their own area. In total, this is more than SEK 130 billion of investment in the semiconductor industry in the U.S. And by the capacity investments that you have seen, we, of course, want to take our share of that. Then as I said, the highlevel picture of, of the acquisitions. So if you look at the top part, which is the semi part, weve always said we want to control the processes in semiconductor and we manage the pressure through our vacuum pumps. We manage the temperature through our chillers and cryo pumps, and we manage the environmental services through our abatement systems. So if you look at the three up there with Brooks and now Montana Instruments, Montana is again related to Quantum, we go deeper into our capabilities of doing, doing thermal management. Then the middle part, the green part with Ceres and Qolibri. Its really going into the recycling, the recovery of precious materials, and with Qolibri actually offering solutions for fullline abatements so that we can be much more efficient in abating hazardous gases. iTrap is a pure inline on tool process control piece of equipment that we bought from size, some time ago. Then at the bottom part, we talk industrial. So I mentioned that on liquid ring pump, we did organically. We did develop our own products within Edwards and Atlas Copco. And now were doing a rollup strategy with acquisitions in China, in Germany and U.S., where we really step for step get to buy channels and products to grow the liquid ring business. Liquid ring, by the way, is a 400 is an 800 million business. So its a big part. Then Ill talk about applications. The three in the light blue are mainly focusing on specific applications. And then the last part, bottom right is we entered into Mobile Vacuum. That is about 400 million. We did we were not present in that market. And now with the acquisition of National Vacuum Equipment, we become the leading partner already in U.S., and we will now roll that out. So good acquisition progress, also a good pipeline for more acquisitions. So then how did we manage to become the 1 in industrial vacuum. Its all about presence, application knowledge and having the products and the operations ready. So thats the 3 parts. So if you look at the market, theres actually very few people that make vacuum pumps. I said here, 50, of which about 10 are now already within the Atlas Copco Group. So we continue to screen and see if we can get more of the OEMs in helping us to grow the business. And then theres hundreds of smaller companies who have a typical or a specific application knowledge, yes. And by combining the two, getting stronger and having the products and then going into people that have the application knowledge and the contact with the customer, those two combined give us the full potential to grow in industrial vacuum, and we continue to do that. Now maybe a slightly complicated slide. If you look at the bottom of the triangle, this is our core business. So in our core business, we continue to develop new products organically to grow the business. And there, we have a global presence with the brands on the right with Atlas Copco Leybold and Edwards. So this is the majority of our business, which we grow organically. Organically and through acquisition, if you look at the bottom left, so HHV, a producer in India, Schroeder Equipment, MC Schroeder is a distributor in the U.S. organizes a very specific application company in Germany. So global presence with all our brands and increasing the application and the channel with the acquisitions. Moving one level up, we come to liquid ring pumps, was new for us. We were small. We had a global presence with Atlas Copco and Edwards. So from the acquisition of Edwards, now we I said that we do the rollup in here by acquiring more companies for product and for channels. And very soon, we will be a strong player in this one as well. Then the Mobile Vacuum and we dont do that yet as Atlas Copco, Edwards or Leybolds. We have acquired NVE. We get into the application and the understanding now and then we will globalize that business than using the other brands. And similar to the side channel blower, the top part of the triangle, where we now are starting with a factor probably through Ehrler and Beck. And then again, the next steps will be to acquire our own products and to roll it out with the brands that we have. So on the left you could say is the acquisition activity, on the right is then using our global presence and the strengths of our brands within vacuum. Slightly different picture for scientific vacuum there. And then we used to be a pump provider. We were making scrolls and roots and turbo vacuum pumps. Then we move on. I showed that in the development to having more accessories, the controls, the gauges to add to the pumps. Then we have developed now a very strong systems business. The picture you see there is space testing chamber, huge, huge thing, but full of scientific vacuum equipment, where we test the engines of the satellites and the operation of the satellites. And were moving very quickly towards kind of a platform supplier where we give our products, including the controls to the customer. A customer can really easily connect to its own platform. And then you dont have to worry about it anymore, you can control it on your tablet, on your phone and you manage the whole vacuum system within the customers application. So thats the steps were going through for scientific vacuum. This is our presence. The blinking part is where were building new factories. So inching now in Korea and then a lot in the States, one in Europe. So we are already very well represented, but we continue to work on that with new capacity in the right regions. And this is the same picture but now highlighting the service technology centers. So part of our service and Ill come to that is that we follow our big customers and build a service hub next to the big customers. And so now we have built a new one in Dublin and in Arizona for all the semiconductor investments. And we a new one in China and Langfang and extended Taiwan, Singapore and our hub in Israel. So really following the customer and make sure we are the supplier of choice. Then coming to service. This is our performance in, in service. We have grown our service business over the years since we are in Vacuum since 2014 with 20. So really, we put very high focus and drive our service business. Its still only around 25 of our business, which is a bit lower compared to the figures youve seen for the group. But of course, our growth and equipment has been very steep as well. So I think to stay at 25 is a fantastic performance. So how are we doing that? We have 2 service divisions. This is the Vacuum Technique service, which is our Mobile Vacuum solution, very much comparable with the Compressor Technique. In fact, here, we have invested in direct sales, we used to have a mix of equipment sales and service sales. So that is now really, really bearing fruit. Focus on customer satisfaction. Before we acquired, there was a lot of third parties giving service. We now go really directly with the superior service to the customers. We changed the business model. We talked a lot about SmartLink and what is vacuum doing. We have it now. Ill show you on the next slide. We have connectivity. Every machine that leaves the factory has the connectivity built in. We have the platforms for our customer and for our service people, so we actually do exactly the same as Compressor Technique. And then consolidation. What we do now we deliver a vacuum technique service, which means that our service engineers can service the Atlas Copco, the label all the Edwards product, which is much more efficient for us and much better for the customer. Weve only done that now because we needed some time to develop new products in a modular way. So basically, the core of the vacuum system is the same, whatever brand you go to. So our service technicians are now trained to do vacuum technique service, which gives us a lot of efficiency. This is the Genius. We call it Genius. Compressor Technique is going at SmartLink. So as I said, every machine has it and we also have a retrofit. So when we do a service standards, we will put our Genius in there, and we have the full connectivity of the vacuum machines with our service and for the customer. What are we doing in semiconductor? There was for a very long time, this culture in semiconductor where they were running to crash. So they were running the pump until it died and then we had to replace it and refurbish it. We still do that. But we have been since actually earlier, but here, the graph shows since 2021, going to the customer, try to convince the customer that its much more efficient and much more lower cost for the customer to do preventive maintenance. And now we start to get the real success in that. So more and more fabs are coming to us, and we develop together a preventative maintenance scheme. And you see on the left how this is growing, how it is improving our profitability, while at the same time, were lowering the cost for the fab owners. And then I took one specific contract on the right where you could see even up to June, it was all run to crush, and then we came in and up to now, most of the interventions are preventative, which saves the customer a lot of wafers. And as I said, last but not least, people. When you talk capacity, its about people, its about installed capacity and its about supply chain. In some areas, we were struggling to recruit because of the enormous growth that we have. So we focus really very much on attracting and developing our talent. We have the rule now in Vacuum Technique that minimum 5 of our people have to be young people that come in as graduates as here in industry apprentices so that we really build the talent from within the same with leadership. We want to create that behavior for performance into our leaders and again, grow the leaders from within and then culture first. We want to create that passion for vacuum. We focus very much on wellbeing. We focus on DI, Diversity and Inclusion to create that culture of being an attractive employer within the vacuum industry. So then what are we doing to go into a low carbon society. First of all, we try to avoid to use fossil fuels. And it was mentioned in some of the movies before. All our factories have solar now to power the premises. So where we can, we avoid using any form of fossil fuels. Then as the second one we replace when we are using fossil fuels, we are replacing it by a cleaner form of energy. And a typical example, and youll see that this afternoon is our electric abatement. The majority is still fuel based. We move to electrical abatement. We recover the waste heat that is generated in our vacuum pumps. Of course, reduce I mean, every project we have in engineering has a very, very tough target on reducing the energy consumption. So that is driving in there. Again, you will see an example. Very important now is the recovery and the recycling. This is the circular economy. If you can take some of the products used in the process, you can recycle, purify and then feed back in the process, you save an enormous amount of money for the customer. And then only at the end, if all the steps from one to four have been done, then we abate what is the remainder product to comply with legislation. So these are the steps, the 5 steps we go through in every process. So as the products and better products by continuous innovation I hope I convinced you we built a lot of extra capacity to deal with future growth. We go local for local. Connectivity is now in standards, its all about data. We look after our people and we contribute to a low carbon society. So I think thats the summary for Vacuum Technique. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Thank you, Geert. We will now have a short break, 20 minutes. So please be back in this room 10:50, to listen to the next presentation. Thank you. Break DANIEL ALTHOFF: So welcome back. It was a really short break. But now its time for the last presentation before the QA. So join me on stage Henrik, Business Area President for Industrial Technique. HENRIK ELMIN, SENIOR EVP BUSINESS AREA PRESIDENT OF INDUSTRIAL TECHNIQUE, ATLAS COPCO AB: Perfect. Thank you, Daniel. So good morning, everybody. Its really my pleasure to give you an update on Industrial Technique. I think we have a lot of exciting things happening in our industry. And also, we have worked on some new things regarding our strategic direction for a while. And I think we see that starting to pay off now also in 2022. So great timing for an update. On the agenda, similar to previously here, I will start with some facts and basics around the business area but then spend most of the time on the trends that we see and also the main, lets say, strategic focus areas that we are working on in order to position us for the future and, at the end, how do we contribute also to a lowcarbon society. Lets start with some of the basics here. Industrial Technique, its a quite general name. What do we do? Actually, we serve quite a lot of different customers, but a bit more than half is related to automotive. In the automotive industry, we work across the value chain, but we supply both automated and manual or handheld assembly solutions, but now also since a couple of years, vision systems or machine vision for different type of applications. Second and third biggest industry for us is electronics and aerospace where we also focus on assembly solutions, also drilling in aerospace. But then we serve a lot of other customers here, big, small, mediumsized, in different industries. So quite a diverse business in that sense. Here, you see our development during the last years and as you can see, we have had a strong development on orders in 2022. Also revenues picking up, especially here in the last couple of quarters. What is driving this? In general, you can say that our business is very much driven by CapEx investments from our customers. Its very much about new production lines, new capacity but also new models like we see now in the car industry, a lot of new models. But the customers also invest in more efficient production, more automation, more quality on the production line. And here also, we have solutions, and that is also one part of it. Deglobalization. We see many global customers that also have a more regional setup, having more, lets say, a broader footprint in their production. The service business is more linked to industrial production in general and production volumes. Its, of course, linked more to how much our equipment is used. But that is more the smaller part. If we go into the regional split here, this has also changed a bit over the last couple of years. Right now, 36 of our business is from Americas 31 Europe, Middle East and Africa 33 in Asia. In 2018, we had about 28 from Asia, now its 33. And Europe has also declined in terms of relative share. Most of the big or all the big regions here have been growing with the strongest growth in Asia, also driven much by China. Lets then take a look a little bit at what we do. I would summarize it as smart manufacturing solution. And here, you have a bit of a matrix. You have automotiverelated business and then general industry, which is how we name all other industries. Its aerospace, electronics, but many other customers. We have, over the years, broadened in automotive, more assembly solutions. Also in general industry, we have added in during the years. In the last couple of years, the 2 main additions to our portfolio is in the light green at the bottom here, dispensing in electronics, a company called Scheugenpflug, protecting electronics by dispensing different type of materials. That is going very well, growing and also diversifying the portfolio. And then to the right, we have 3 acquisitions: ISRA VISION, Perceptron, Quiss, creating also a new division in machine vision, both focusing on automotive and what we call surface vision that I will come back to. The customers industries, its very broad. We have, as I said, a lot in automotive, but its also very diverse in many other customer segments. Its about white goods, its wind turbines, solar cells, et cetera, et cetera. And we really help these customers to produce their products on the production line in a sustainable, efficient way. But if there is one common denominator in terms of our value proposition, its often about quality. We help these customers to produce the product to the right quality, of course, in a sustainable way. And that is very much whats driving our of course, many other things as well. So lets talk a bit about the trends that we see here. And here, I focus only on technology trends that we are exposed to and really impacting our business. So if we start from the left here, the battery electric powertrains that we see in the automotive, but also in other industries. Its huge for us, and I will come back to that. Going down from there, you see more sensors and electronics in all products. Its, of course, more intelligent products. But for us, it means also more electronics needs to be assembled on the production line. And it also means business for Scheugenpflug when it comes to protecting that electronics that helps our business. Then you have 3 more production technologyrelated trends: inline quality control, flexible automation, datadriven solution. Our customers wants to check the quality in every step on the production line to avoid any errors. They want to automate it. As weve heard here today, its tough to find labor and the more you can automate the better often. And there, we have also a new, lets say, focus area for us. And then its about data, and I will come back to that as well. Then we have one area of lightweighting. The fact that the automotive industry, especially, but also in aerospace, use more light material like aluminum, that drives the need for more sophisticated, advanced joining methods, assembly solutions, and that has been one of the drivers for our expansion in automotive. That has gone a little bit back and forth. But right now, with batteries being so heavy in the cars, we see actually an increased focus on more lighter material in the cars again. And sustainability is really a key, very integrated in our also value proposition. I will come back to that. Lets start then with battery electric vehicles. What does it mean for us? Well, first, some basic statistics here. Today, 22, 13 of the sales is electric vehicles, including hybrids. 2030, the expectation is it could be 45 of the sales. So the message here is really its just beginning, right? This is really driving a lot of new models and investments. Then on the total volume of cars, its plus 2 is this prediction. Its less impressive, but its also less of the driver for our business. Its more the investment in CapEx related to the new models. So what are then the challenges for battery electric vehicle manufacturers where we also are coming in with our solutions? I mean, first of all, its a race really going on, time to market. And at the same time, its so much new technology in these cars. So our customers want to work earlier with suppliers, partners in order to develop these solutions. So we see that we are earlier involved in working with the leading customers here to find the best production solutions to put this battery together. And its moving a lot. Of course, then the new things is really the core of the car. The battery is really about capacity, performance and very, very strategic for customers. At the same time, nothing can go wrong. If you have defects, recalls, reputational risk. Its more and more critical to have a trusted partner to really make sure that the process is done correctly at the right quality. And then sustainability. If you drive it on green electricity, that is good, but at the same time, its a heavier car, a lot of material needs to be recyclable. So the increased focus is more on the material and the production of the car itself than when its used, but that is also a very important driver. So we started many years ago in developing with the leading, you can say, companies in this field to develop the new solutions. And here you see 11 steps in the value chain where we have solutions. And it starts from actually now with machine vision checking the battery film that goes into the cell, and it ends up with the full battery pack here at the end. So the message is its a lot of different applications. Then this is for prismatic cells. You have also the round cylindrical cells, and then the steps are very different, and you have approximately 11 other applications. You will also see some of this, this afternoon, but its a lot of different applications that we are working on here. So how do we then work with the customers? A key is our innovation center set up. Its we have them around the world. One of our biggest ones is in Germany. And this is where customers are coming to us with their parts early on to actually develop these production solutions to make sure it can be also assembled in the end. So we get we are and we are almost, you can say, fully booked here with and its almost entirely about the battery production. But I will show a video here from our innovation center in Germany. presentation HENRIK ELMIN: So great. And I think one area that has made us quite unique in this space is really that we have this broad portfolio of several assembly technologies, also machine vision which works very well when we want to find these new solutions. So what does it then mean for us in total from Industrial Technique? Here, we have checked facts. Weve taken 2 similar car models. One combustion engine model from 2018 and one of the latest battery EV models from 2022 at a similar level, lets say. And then we have compared across the value chain and also for the 2 main parts of our offer. Do we have more or less content per car if we look at it? And if we take the tier side, its mainly then the powertrain. So either the combustion engine or the battery and electric motor, et cetera, and then its body shop, paint shop and, at the end, the final assembly. And we see then a completely new business and its quite big around dispensing. There was very little in combustion engine, close to 0. But here, its a big new business. But also on tightening, nuts and bolts, we actually see about the same amount of business for us. Body shop, paint shop, relatively unchanged. But then in final assembly, we also see more critical steps. This is partly linked to the battery application, but also a lot of more electronics sensors in these cars. So its not driven only by the battery part, but its also increasing for tightening. So a good upside for us. Then I will move into our second area, its machine vision, to give an update on the progress here. So we decided a couple of years ago to go into machine vision. We see it as an attractive growing market. And we also see that it fits very well into the Atlas Copco business model and DNA. But also we see clear synergies with the other divisions in Industrial Technique. And its really about 2 things, flexible automation and inline quality control. The customers want to, in this flow of production, automate with robots. They need eyes to do the work properly. And its about checking the quality. It can be to check the paint of a car or it can be to check that parts are present. Here, we have a couple of example of applications. Inline gauging, where you measure something to make sure its in the right dimensions, robot guidance and then quality inspection. So its really our focus here is on the production line with machine vision. But also with ISRA, we have a very attractive business in other industries that we call surface vision. This is the continuous production of materials. Can be glass, metal, paper, but also solar cells, et cetera, that is produced in a running flow like this. And then a big part of the ISRA business is to check the surfaces here and detect any defects, classify them to help also the process control of these different materials. Then there is one new things that we have, lets say, frontloaded on, invested in, that is starting to grow now. And that is what we call integrated vision. We combine assembly technologies with vision. And this is one example where you want to automate a wheel assembly process. This is normally done manually today but now with by combining vision and assembly technologies, we can build these type of solutions. So here you see the end of the arm tooling, includes both vision, mechanics, also assembly technologies in order to assemble this wheel automatically. And you can find those type of applications throughout the automotive production. So if we summarize then our gotomarket strategy, we have machine vision solutions as a standalone division to the right here. Two business lines, approximately the same size. Yes, one is surface vision, doing this quality control of continuously produced materials. And then we have smart factory automation, more discrete production where you do robot guidance, quality control, et cetera. But then we also have the integrated solutions that go through the other product divisions of Industrial Technique, and it becomes a component intelligent part of the solutions that we sell through the other divisions. So it can be also for handheld tools. But here you see quality control of dispensing and wheel assembly application that typically that I showed before. So this is really key. And we focus on applicationspecific products. Its not about standard smart cameras that can be generically used. Its more optimized solutions that are still standardized, but built for certain applications. So to summarize machine vision, we will continue to innovate in these applicationspecific products, develop integrated vision. At the same time, we are investing, I would say, frontloading in building the platform for growth, presence globally, but also operational excellence, people management and development and also the proactive service business is really a good fit for machine vision. And then, of course, to continue also inorganically to add to the portfolio. Then well move over to general industry. We have dedicated divisions that focus also on the other segment when it comes to, for example, tightening, but also other tools. And here, we have also invested quite a lot. We have done quite well over the years, but we still feel that this market is even bigger. There is more to do. And if we then look at what is this really, again, lets take a look at the typical society here. Again, if we talk about tightening, its very much about the offhighway type of equipment, one of the challenges with these segments. And here, Ive taken 3. Lets take wind turbines, electronics and aerospace. One of the challenges is that the needs are quite different. A lot of the technology from automotive is still applicable, but it needs to be adapted and optimized for, as you can see here, obviously, quite different production environments. And some years back, we started also to increase the relative RD investments into some of these areas and absolute as well in order to make sure that we have good portfolios. And here, we have 3 of our biggest segments which are growing and actually then now I think we have really strong complete portfolios, both, for example, for wind turbines, electronics and aerospace. And in that way, I strongly believe we can also accelerate the growth. But it is not only if you see the tools here, its not only about the tools. If we think about transformation, how can we sell more to the same customers, we have this slightly complex illustration here with 2 transformation ladders. One to the left is for manual handheld applications. And on the right side, you have the automated solutions where our equipment ends up on a robot, which happens more and more. And the factor 5 here is if you transform from a more traditional tool into a smart tool, the value we can provide to customers can multiply by 5 typically. Its quite a big step, but its also a completely different level of performance and quality that we provide. And the same applies for automated tools. Then we have the next level, and its really on the left side about a workstation. Here, its about operator guidance, software, machine vision to help the operator do a more productive job but also make sure there are no errors whatsoever in the process. And then we see a typical, lets say, average upside of multiplying by another 3 in terms of the value we provide. If you take the automated solution, also applicable in automotive, it can be a factor of 10. So we invest quite a lot in these other bricks around core equipment. And that really creates more value for the customer, but its also differentiating us quite well from competition because this is it needs some investments and its a lot about competence. And here, were now also looking at 22, start to see real traction in many areas. Then our service business. Its one of the core differentiators for Industrial Technique. Its the reason why we win the second order, take care of the customer, and its sometimes the major differentiator compared to competition. And we have, over the years, built up strong service portfolio. Here, we have also included consumables in these numbers. We are at 27 as a ratio with high growth on equipment and also the limited limitations on car production has been a little bit flat later, but we continue to see this as a big upside going forward. So what is then the focus for service. In manufacturing, most equipment today, also ours is connected. Our power tools, but also dispensing systems, et cetera. Its really connected. Theres a lot of data collected. But there is very little done with the data, at least proactively. If there is a problem, you go back and check, but there is so much potential value in working with the data in order to optimize both production and quality. And let me then take one example. One of our most popular service products, we call tool management centers. This is when we have an onsite workshop with big customers between 1 and 30 people that work inside the customers plant next to the line. And now we see great opportunity to use data around our equipment and the processes we provide. And we also use our service technicians to together with data, to help them improve quality and production. So here, you can think about Atlas Copco service technician seeing the overview of the line, working with the customers, there is a warning and you go out on the line and you actually, together with the customer and you hopefully avoid a problem that would have occurred otherwise. We also invest a lot in the data analytics and also cloudbased solutions. This also applies, by the way, for machine vision where you can do much more scalable analysis and be even more efficient in fixing problems or avoiding problems for the customer. I should also say that these 270 tool management centers, I checked in 2018, we had 200 of those. So we are adding around 20 of those tool management centers every year if you look historically. So really good progress there. Then lets have a look at how we contribute to more, lets say, low carbon or sustainable society. As you heard, we have committed to the sciencebased targets and are fully committed on our product side, but also our own operation, but also our customers have done that. Its about 4,000 companies now that have joined sciencebased targets, but also quite a big share of them have challenges to reach those commitments. And this is really a great opportunity for us when it comes to the assembly lines out there. So when we work in sales, of course, its about cost saving, productivity improvements, but its also about reducing carbon footprint for the customer. This is very high on the decision criteria today for the customers compared to just a few years back. And we have a very structured handson process where we actually walk the line station by station with the customer to identify and see where are the opportunities here where you can reduce the carbon footprint in the production, that is Scope 1 and 2, but also on Scope 3, how can we help customers make even more sustainable products and have more less Scope 3 from footprint from their perspective. So at the end, its very much about transparency, working with the customers, prioritizing the investments and also, of course, here, if you take Scope 1 and 3, we invest in more energyefficient tools and also tools that have an embedded controller. So you can also take away quite a lot of hardware. On the Scope 3, its a little bit more longer investments, bigger changes since its involving the customers product. Here, we have one solution that is called Smart.Adjust that I just wanted to exemplify. But this is a great opportunity in the battery applications. So if we look at this picture up there, its about when you put the battery modules into the battery tray, you need this blue material called gap filler to make sure that the battery is connected to the frame. And in that way, its cooled properly. If you have too little of that material, the battery can overheat. Most car manufacturers put an average of and a little bit extra of that material in to make sure that you have enough so that the batteries are cooled. But when you optimize this, you can actually reduce quite a lot of material. So what we do, both ISRA and dispensing together, is that we actually then pick up the battery modules, and we measure on each individual battery, the shape of the battery to know how much gap there will be when you put it into the tray and we also measure the shape of the tray that also varies piece by piece. And then we optimize the amount of that blue material that is needed so you have just enough to actually make sure the battery is cooled properly, but you dont have too much. So this, as an example, reduces the weight of a car 2 kilogram and its a lot of money, but also, from a sustainability perspective, a great benefit for our customers. So that is an example of sustainability. Then a little bit about our people strategy in Industrial Technique. I mean we have really a fantastic team in Industrial Technique, and we get to work with so many exciting industries and companies across different segments and globally. And there is a lot of opportunities out there. So we have focused a lot now also on that full potential. How can we really realize that full potential with all these changes going on in the industry? And one of the concrete examples is what we call Customer Center of the Future. As you have seen, a lot of the potential for us is to sell more advanced solutions, more complex sales process. And we see that we can help our sales teams to free up time from other tasks to spend even more, a higher share of their time, on selling these complex solutions, transforming the customers. So we have to make, lets say, the us future proof and to realize this, invested a lot in digitalization also in sales and marketing. And this really changes the way we work in the customer center. But and the target is really more sales per salesperson. Its so much about competence and application knowledge for us in terms of developing the business. We have the target of at least 40 hours per year training for every employee, but we also have a quite diverse market, many opportunities. So we work with these agile teams to crossfunctional small teams to go after and test new things when it comes to all these new applications. And we really believe in this decentralized model to be fast in realizing this. And then to attract and develop people, I mean inclusive culture, diversity is key to stay innovative and we are doing quite a lot here. One of our successful examples here is what we have introduced for Industrial Technique is a Global Industrial Internship Program. What we do is that we bring in students from all around the world to work before they graduate to work on certain projects within Industrial Technique, real problems. And they need they also get to work and interact in a global environment. And then at the end of the project, they are presented to Industrial Technique management, including myself. And its been a really good feedback on that, and it also puts us very much on the map with the key universities. Great. So that was a short overview of Industrial Technique. Very quick summary. I think we see a lot of technology and global trends. We feel that we are really well positioned here. Its both about the customers product, for example, battery vehicles, but its also about production technology and automation is very big for us. Big step and good start around machine vision. We have a clear, lets say, positioning in that quite broad market space with applicationspecific products, but also these integrated vision solutions that also goes through the other divisions. And then, of course, sustainability, more as an integral part of how we actually drive our business now, of course, making our own commitments as well, but its really a good fit for our often more optimized solutions. Very good. Thank you so much for that. Questions and Answers DANIEL ALTHOFF: Thank you, Henrik. Please stay on stage. Were going to have the QA session. So welcome up to join us, Geert, Peter and Mats. We will now run this session in this room, and Im sure there are plenty of questions out there. Operator Instructions So I think we have the first question here in the front. Im sure Klas is eager to ask. KLAS HENRIK BERGELIND, MD, CITIGROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: My first question is for you, Geert. So growth has been 20 in service in line with equipment. The share is still 25. You talk about service engineers can now service all brands. Its a new thing. You also say that on the semi side, you dont have the customers running for crash at the moment. We always had this not issue, but we had this effect of less spare parts in vacuum relative to CT. We also didnt have as many service technicians on site. Do you think this preventive maintenance sort of driven business model can increase that share from 25 over time? Or are you still sort of limiting around this level? Thats my first one. GEERT FOLLENS: Its a very good question, Klas. The fact that we are hanging at 25, as I showed, is mainly because the equipment sales has grown enormously. So I think 20 growth in service is a very good performance. And if we can continue to do that, I would think over time that, that percentage will grow. It will probably never reach the Compressor Technique percentage. As you mentioned, theres less consumables in a vacuum process than there is in a compressor process, but Im sure the percentages, relative to revenues, will continue to grow, partly because we take share back from the third parties, but also because we sell more uptime rather than a pure refurbishment of a company, which increases the value for the or the cost decreases the cost for the company, increases the value for us. And all these parameters drive towards a higher service business and more resilience for our business. DANIEL ALTHOFF: I think we have a question here, Anders? ANDERS IDBORG, ANALYST, ABG SUNDAL COLLIER HOLDING ASA, RESEARCH DIVISION: Anders Idborg from ABG. This one is for Geert as well. On the health of the semi customers in China, given the export restrictions, et cetera, its pretty hard to follow from the outside. I see youre expanding capacity there. But what is the view on the ground there? I mean what are the direct effects on your customers in their ability to expand capacity and the indirect effects on you? GEERT FOLLENS: Yes. So what we see happening in China for the moment is there is amongst the Chinese producers, theres a level of uncertainty with the new restrictions. Theyre all applying now for licenses to continue to get the equipment they need. So thats for the Chinese producers. What you see is the foreign producers like Samsung, TSMC, they have already obtained the licenses. So if we look at the Chinese market today, its the Chinese players make the chips which are somewhat lower in performance, the foreign players make the highend chips. There is hesitation and some turbulence. But in the end, it will continue to grow. So I expect within a quarter, we will have stability again and then the Chinese will continue to grow. MATS RAHMSTRM: I think you also may want to add. In terms of our sales to these customers, the direct impact to us is very limited. GEERT FOLLENS: Its minimal. We have our American products with cryo, which, of course, is directly impacted. The our vacuum pumps and abatement systems dont have American content. So there, theres no restrictions at all for us. So the direct impact is minimal. The indirect impact, as I said, will depend on how many licenses they get. The direct impact, we dont see at all basically for the moment. MATS RAHMSTRM: So its, of course, that the American toolmakers needs to get their licenses if were going to be successful as well and it will increase speed among the local tool makers. GEERT FOLLENS: Yes, exactly. Absolutely. DANIEL ALTHOFF: I think we have next question here to the right. MATTIAS HOLMBERG, ANALYST, DNB MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mattias Holmberg from DNB. Question for Henrik. I was interested by the transformation potential you talked about when going from sort of a basic tool to an automatic tool or a smart tool being some 3 to 10x higher. Just to be clear, is that the total value of the product over its entire life cycle we were talking about or was this sort of some other metric? And also, to better understand the potential, how far have you come in terms of penetration with this type of more advanced tools compared to the basic ones? HENRIK ELMIN: If we take the lower level that transformation into smart tools, it excludes also the service business that would be on top, so to say. Then if we take now the next level, which was more automated solutions and also with integrated vision, we have started to launch a few products and it starts to have, lets say, a significant impact on our numbers as well in terms of growth. So its a very good start, but there is a lot of other applications we can do. MATTIAS HOLMBERG: What do you want to say if its sort of a low singledigit penetration rate or talking double digits on the order that youre taking now? HENRIK ELMIN: In terms of how much of the potential or... MATTIAS HOLMBERG: How much that is on the smart side compared to... HENRIK ELMIN: Okay. If you take automotive, most of the tool transformation has already happened. Its all transformed, I would say, 80, 90. The big step there is to take the next step into workstations or automated solution. On the general industry side, its well ahead, but there is still maybe have to be done on the smart tool side, but then we have again the next level with workstation and automation. So I think the limitation is more on us how to transform the market. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Next question, Daniela Costa. DANIELA C. R. DE CARVALHO E COSTA, MD AND HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN CAPITAL GOODS EQUITY RESEARCH TEAM, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So my question relates back to the first presentation. I think Mats has a slide which had the new areas of opportunity, and you said it was SEK 11 billion, if I got it correct. That was the sales for Atlas, I imagine. Can you talk about like the addressable market opportunity compared to your current segments? And maybe to link that up with the target of the 8, should we think about the 8, given these new opportunities, more like a bit more MA going forward rather than organic compared to the past? MATS RAHMSTRM: I think 2 ways. Were going to need both to invest in organic development. And some of these projects are very organic, like we see in hydrogen and low pressure, for example. But then we also need to speed up the number of acquisitions. And why I wanted to show this was exactly what we say, how do we back up the 8 in the coming years? And this was around SEK 11 billion this year for these segments. And since we are not always interested in the total addressable market, just the more profitable part, so its not always that we know ourselves exactly. And some of these are, of course, very dependent on what will happen with hydrogen. Will we see subsidies like we will see in the U.S. now to accelerate hydrogen? What will happen to that market? Biogas is, we know, its not an efficient way without subsidies, but will that happen as well? So for us, its more entering in to be ready, but its not like we know exactly how the total market looks like. But in many of these cases, I would say that probably 15x. You can take these numbers that we have there. If you go for all these segments, that can be a definition maybe. I think you do that calculation for me. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Good. We have another question here to Sebastian. SEBASTIAN KUENNE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: Sebastian Kuenne, RBC. A question for Henrik. You talk a lot about products for new EV cars and most of the investments that weve seen in the last 2 years was on EV, but I get the feeling that theres a lot of pentup demand now created in the conventional car market. Do you see there are more projects coming or because 80 of cars are still conventional. HENRIK ELMIN: Conventional cars, you mean combustion engine cars? SEBASTIAN KUENNE: Combustion, yes. HENRIK ELMIN: I would say a lot of the new projects driven by, lets say, new production lines, new models, and that is what is driving our business, is linked to EV. Its relatively little that for us is conventional cars. But of course, there is still some productivity improvement, some business going on. But the bigger projects is very much linked to the EV or plugin hybrid trend. SEBASTIAN KUENNE: What do you see in 5 years time when still half of the cars are ICE cars? That business has collapsed. So I was wondering whether you think this is coming back. HENRIK ELMIN: Yes. But I think it if this trend is followed, I mean it needs to come back a little bit but because of at some time, the also these production lines needs to be upgraded. So but still, I foresee most of the business around the EVs in the next couple of years. MATS RAHMSTRM: Maybe, Henrik, you can say that. Maybe some of the traditional cars, they are more driven by OpEx, but its a service industry, its new tool, backup tools, smaller shifters in models, but new engine programs is extremely limited, of course. And of course, most of the CapEx goes into EVs or hybrids. Is that correct? HENRIK ELMIN: Absolutely. The OpEx and service is linked to more of the current production volumes. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Good. We have Gustaf. GUSTAF SCHWERIN, RESEARCH ANALYST, HANDELSBANKEN CAPITAL MARKETS AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Gustaf Schwerin, Handelsbanken. Also on industrial and the auto side, the slide you showed there on the content per vehicle, difference between EVs and combustion, do you want to give a rough number on how much bigger the content is? HENRIK ELMIN: I mean it varies quite a lot model by model. And here, weve taken one example. So I think its I dont want to give a number, but I would say its significant, but we dont talk about multiplying or anything, but its significant, I would say. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Max has a question. MAX R. YATES, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Its Max from Morgan Stanley. This is for Geert. Could you talk a little bit about capital intensity sorry, or vacuum intensity? So if we think about kind of going forward, some of these new processes, are you able to give us a feel for kind of how much more I mean its a similar question to the one before, but for you vacuum content kind of we might see going forward? GEERT FOLLENS: Yes. What you clearly see, we talk about miniaturization. If you go from 7 to 5 to 3 nanometer, you have more process steps to get there. So each process step or most of the process steps, you use vacuum. So smaller chips is more steps, is more vacuum pumps, basically. Thats the simple equation. And another important because we I mentioned miniaturization but there is a limit to what you can do in one plane. So now both in memory, finance and in logic, you go 3dimensional with FinFET and gateallaround. So going 3dimensional again means more vacuum and different processes like ALD, where you need to connect the layers and have very thin holes on the chips. So miniaturization is more process steps, but also growing vertical is more process steps. So that all increases the use of vacuum. There was, what, 2, 3 years ago, saying, oh, EUV will reduce the number of vacuum steps because you can do so much more with an EUV machine. We actually see the opposite because EUV is often put on a bottleneck process. But around that, you have many more processes as well. So vacuum intensity is there to become more important. Also, if you to deal with all the challenges to make the chips, you need more hazardous materials. So while the vacuum intensity increases in the process, you have a much bigger challenge in burning off or recovering, as you will see this afternoon, of the materials that are used in the process. So its on the vacuum side and on the abatement side that the new trends create more intensity. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Thank you, Geert. We have another question back here to the right. RIZK MAIDI, EQUITY ANALYST, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Its Rizk Maidi from Jefferies. Still on Vacuum Technique. Can we please have an update on the progress you made on the pricing in that business where I think the last few quarters, you talked about price resistance? And also, your views just on the price elasticity when volumes are coming down? GEERT FOLLENS: Yes. The for us, we have increased prices. And Im extremely happy what we have done in the diffuse market. So in industrial vacuum and part of scientific vacuum and in service. So there, we have really good price development. The situation is slightly different in the big OEMs in scientific vacuum and in semiconductor because there I mean these are huge contracts, longterm contracts. So its somewhat more difficult there. We work more with surcharges that we can apply because of certain special circumstances. So there is a different model. But of course, with the big OEMs, the effect is somewhat smaller than in the diffuse market. On price elasticity, I think the last 2 years, this market has been driven by availability. I mean its not because you increase your prices a little bit that your volume will drop because the customers need the product. So we havent seen that elasticity in the recent years. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Okay. I think Johan. JOHAN SJBERG, EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: Johan from Kepler. A question for you, Peter. If you could talk a little bit about the operational leverage, how you see that progressing going forward? And also just give an update how you see if theres any change to your longterm target or goal for that? PETER KINNART: Talking about dropthrough for our operations, of course, in 2022, over the last 3 quarters, that has been a bit more challenging. I think the current status has been that with the efforts from all the different business areas on pricing, we feel that we have been able to mitigate most of the structural cost increases that are most likely going to be in place also going forward. But we have not, lets say, pushed the envelope to the level that we would also compensate for other type of impact that we have seen. We have seen high increase of logistic costs at a certain point in time, which is maybe now a little bit improving or, lets say, the spot market buying that we typically have engaged in order to secure chips so that we could actually push out the products that our customers so desperately needed, so from that point of view, of course, it has been quite challenging. The supply chain from what we hear from all the different business areas is not really improving substantially at this particular point in time. So I think it will continue to remain a bit of a struggle to see how we can improve that situation. But ultimately, of course, with the orders on hand that we have and the increasing capacity that we foresee and maybe also due to some economic downturn or at least a softer economic environment, the supply chains might, of course, ease up a little bit more. And that would allow us to produce more, and that should, of course, result in a better dropthrough gradually over time. JOHAN SJBERG: But youre still targeting between 30 and 40, is that your guidance on it? PETER KINNART: Well, thats, of course, a longterm average that we generally tend to refer to. At times, it has been significantly higher than that. And at times currently, unfortunately, it is, of course, significantly lower than that or even negative. Whether we will be able to reach that in the next quarter or the first quarter next year, that is very difficult to predict, depending on the exact environment that we are operating in. But ultimately, the long term, of course, is that we are able to deliver on that kind of range of dropthrough. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Thank you, Peter. We have another question here in the middle. JOEL ADAM SPUNGIN, ANALYST, JOH. BERENBERG, GOSSLER CO. KG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Its Joel Spungin from Berenberg. Ive actually got a question on machine vision. I was just wondering sort of with all the MA that youve done in the last few years, where are you on the journey with machine vision? Do you now consider yourself to be a market leader in the machine vision space? Is there more MA that you can do in machine vision? And if so, what sort of things would you be looking at? HENRIK ELMIN: No, but I think machine vision is a very big market, quite fragmented, many applications, and its growing. Right now, we are really focusing on this business model applicationspecific products, but also within that space, there are also good opportunities to do rollup acquisitions. Right now, were also building and stabilizing the platform in line with what I presented before. But the short answer, yes, there is good opportunities to continue to grow it also inorganically. DANIEL ALTHOFF: We do have a question in the very back. MAGNUS KRUBER, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AND RESEARCH ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: Magnus from UBS. I was also intrigued by the transformation potential you talked about in certain applications in IT. If we take that a step further and look at the whole group, how much, should we say, incremental productivity or efficiency do you believe you generate for your customer base across the group every year? And I realize its a difficult question, but maybe you can also talk about the sort of new compressor of Ferrari that you talked about earlier in the presentation. So how much extra efficiency of productivity do you think you get from each product generation? HENRIK ELMIN: And the question was more on the level going to workstations and automated solutions or from a more traditional to more smart tool? MAGNUS KRUBER: Well, both, I was thinking, but more as the whole group level. HENRIK ELMIN: No. But I think the feedback and so far, we see that we generate really good value for the customers by bundling, combining these different technologies into one solution, both when it comes to a manual workstation and automated solution. And the reason is that if youre a customer and you buy this station, you buy a lot of different things, different softwares, different interfaces. It doesnt work so well together. Its a lot of work to make it integrated. And if we can combine certain things in that space and make sure it fits together, one user interface, its very easy, both for the companies building the production line but our customers. So I dont have a number on it, but its a very good feedback from customers on the value we create with that business model. MATS RAHMSTRM: Sometimes, Henrik, you refer to what are the mistakes they do online. Maybe you can elaborate on that if its the operator process part. HENRIK ELMIN: Yes, if you take a tool, a handheld tool that is and we sell a smart tool, of course, you can control certain things like that. There is nothing wrong in the actual joint not involved, but you do not know if you are on the right bolt. You could potentially be tightening a bolt on the wrong car, be too early on the production line or too late. But with also vision technology, you will see it this afternoon, you also know exactly where the operator is with the tool so that you know youre on the right place. Then you have excluded even more errors or potential quality errors that could occur in the and that is a lot of value in some applications. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Now we have questions from the web. Its Jonathan at HSBC. I think its to you, Geert. Could you please take talk more about the hydrogen opportunity in vacuum? Where things stand today? And whether you feel interest is in hydrogen is stalling or accelerating? GEERT FOLLENS: Yes. So this is very much related to the EUV product where they use an enormous amount of hydrogen. So what weve done in the past is we take that hydrogen through the pump. It goes in our abatement system and its burned off. So which is pretty inefficient and you have to produce it and then you just burn it off. The product we have already commercialized now is a hydrogen dilution system where basically you can dilute the hydrogen and just release it to the atmosphere. That is now what we do. The next one, which you will see this afternoon, is a hydrogen recycling system where you take the hydrogen out before abatements, then youre purifying the hydrogen and youre feeding it back into the tool. So basically, you have a closed loop in the hydrogen. In that, we produce the prototypes. The prototypes have been tested. Weve proven that we can reach the number of 9, so 99.69 is purity of the hydrogen. And now we see an enormous traction with all the end customers that use EUV to see how they can implement that into their production related to the EUV tools. Just to show how big the confidence is in that, when we sell an EUV system to TSMC, there are 2 empty slots in that big system, which are ready actually to slide in a hydrogen recovery system. So they are really, really one thing that to happen because for their cost of ownership, this is enormous and for the environment, this is fantastic. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Very interesting. Thank you. We have one question in the back. OLIVER GOTTLIEB, HSBC GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT UK LIMITED: Oliver from HSBC Asset Management. At the group level, youve described many of these interesting circular economy and climate relevant products youre innovating. But I noticed in the annual report, the EUaligned green revenues is around 28. OpEx is 22, and then CapEx is 5. So I just and I noticed you say thats a conservative estimate. But I just wonder, in the future, can we expect those numbers to grow quite significantly? And is there a particular reason for the gap between the 5 and the other numbers, which were in the 20s? PETER KINNART: Referring to the EU taxonomy reporting and, in fact, the eligible portion of that because we have not reported on aligned yet for 2021 in that case. Of course, the taxonomy is a very complicated issue. Theres an enormous amount of tax that is very difficult to really interpret and understand. And even if you go to the legislators, its not getting much clearer very often. So I think everybody is pretty much on a journey towards understanding those criteria in a good way. And of course, for the first time when we reported, we had done a lot of structural work across all the business areas, working very closely together to exchange our processes and understand how we need to measure this. We, of course, tried to take a bit of a conservative approach to it because the last thing we want to be put into this corner of greenwashing. So we adopted a very cautious approach. Its very likely that as this area continues to develop, that these numbers will change over time as we understand better and as we get a better benchmarking also across all the different companies that are, of course, facing this new challenge. So I would say the number is maybe relatively low still, but we definitely wanted to try to be cautious in our approach. We are seeing now that from an eligibility point of view, it is likely that, that number is most is probably higher. If we listen to all of these different topics that Mats has presented across the different business areas when it comes to potential for sustainability in many of our customers applications, then it seems likely that, that number is going to grow. Then on the aligned, it is very likely there that the number will be probably very, very low at the beginning. Not so much because we do not believe that we have we dont have the aligned technologies, but more because the kind of, lets say, evidence that you need to provide, particularly the ISO certified certification of the products and applications. And as that, of course, is quite a long process given the enormous portfolio of products and applications that we need to manage, we will do this step by step as we are able to manage or to measure these different products. And then gradually, we will that number will also probably increase over time. But that is a bit of background on the taxonomy. A bit of early stage to get really solid mature numbers, I would say. And at the same time, of course, a cautious approach on our behalf which is maybe a little bit of a trademark of the house as well that we rather want to be modest but certain about what we show than to be too bold and may be complacent. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Max Yates? MAX R. YATES: Yes. Could I just ask a quick question? You showed that slide where showed all of the fabs being built out through the U.S. and I think you talked about it being SEK 130 billion of CapEx. So I just wanted to understand kind of a little bit about early ordering and maybe kind of how much of that spend has now already translated into orders for you. So how early when these fabs are being built are they putting in orders? And is there any way to quantify? If we look at the sort of 2021 orders, how you would think about kind of normal ordering and what would be preordering? Is that impossible to quantify? Or can you have a go? GEERT FOLLENS: Yes. What they typically do is when they build the fab, first, they will build the shell as we call it. So the fab itself, then they go into installing all the utilities. And then basically, the fab is ready to produce. In the past, you had customers that had empty shells waiting for the boom. Now this is less relevant. If you look at that map in the U.S. from Intel and TSMC, Samsung will be the next one. So they have the fabs. So they are now running pilot lines, and they will then equip the whole fab. And from an early ordering point of view, we dont get orders when theyre in that first phase. We only start to get orders when they run pilots and then, of course, when they decide, this is a stable line, then we see the rest of the orders. So this can be a month, this can be weeks, this can be very close to starting up the fab. So from a preordering point of view, I think there is hardly anything in our order book that relates to all the fabs that have shown in America, except for TSMC and Intel, where they are already equipping the fab. So theres no relation between the map and preordering at all, I would say. MAX R. YATES: Can I just squeeze in one more? Is that Daniel? Just on the competitive landscape, Im just curious whether youve seen obviously, its a super attractive kind of area of market. Have you seen anyone kind of moving in any new competitive developments in terms of whether its... GEERT FOLLENS: No. I think in the, I would say, high end processes, its still the same players as before. What we did see in the easier applications, say, related to load lock or to solar, you have some Chinese or particularly one Chinese and one Taiwanese competitor coming in, but we dont see them at all in the highend harsh semiconductor processes. So there, the competitive landscape has not changed. We fight the same people on the dry pumps, on the turbos, on the cryo. DANIEL ALTHOFF: So thats first round of questions there, and then you, Sebastian, have one other. BERTIE THOMSON: Its Bertie from Brown Advisory. Geert, could you talk a bit about, given the investments youre making, are you able to quantify the SEK amount that youre putting into those investments? And then also the time line youre expecting to finish over, please? GEERT FOLLENS: Yes, we have that very simple rule when we see an investment in a new fab. Its typically around 2 of that investment amount you have seen on the map is vacuum equipment, vacuum and abatement equipment. So thats basically what we do. I would say dont take the SEK 130 billion now and take 2 of that added in one year because thats, of course, over time that, that business will come in. But 2 a bit higher than 2 is a good measure from the CapEx related to vacuum equipment. BERTIE THOMSON: And you expect majority within 5 years, say? GEERT FOLLENS: The map we have shown was 23, 25, 26. So thats what they are doing. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Sebastian? SEBASTIAN KUENNE: I have a question also on vacuum again. The order book is now probably 6 to 7 months lead time, so really full. We now see the problems on the memory side, memory investments, but we also read that TSMC is running some of its 7 nanometer plant at 50 capacity, and they have already put questions on building out the logic CapEx. So yes, your order book is full, but given the news now, do you see a risk of on revenues for next year that you cannot even deliver those orders that you had actually planned to deliver? Or do you are you happy or will you produce that capacity next year as well? GEERT FOLLENS: Yes. What we see of course, we follow that almost on a daily basis. What we see is that there is always a bit of turn in the order book. Some people reshuffle a bit the planning that they have. So you have new orders, cancelations. But the cancelations we see today are actually not material to the size of the order book. So that is not happening. You could say, because of our long lead time, people wouldnt cancel now. But anyway, the cancelations are not material. And the other thing we look at is, of course, the fab utilization. We have very detailed reports of what fab is running at what utilization. And if you take the global average of that, theres still above 90 utilization. There will be a fab where they struggle with yields or where they have a specific process, say, the Apple 14 or something, somewhat lower sales that you see fluctuations. But the global average is above 90. So we dont see that except for memory. In memory, we have seen reductions in CapEx from Micron, from HyNEX. Samsung is a bit more difficult because they do both logic and memory, so they shift a bit. But except for memory, nothing major and cancelations not material. So we are confident that, that order book that we have will take us a long way into next year. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Thank you, Geert. Before Klas, I thought theres a lot of vacuum questions here now. So I thought we should broaden the space with. This is from Niranjan at JPMorgan, and he writes like this. In terms of new products and innovation, you mentioned how Atlas was at the forefront during the transition from pneumatic to electric tools, diesel to electric portable tools and fixed speed to variable speed compressors and vacuum pumps. What are the breakthrough product innovation you foresee and are working on in the future across the businesses? I think you can start, Mats, right? MATS RAHMSTRM: Im not sure I want to talk about the future. But what I think its related to many of the things that were working on. Its related to energy efficiency for 2 reasons. One is cost and payback, energy prices going up. So thats a lot of bang for your back, if you can bring that to the customer. And customers have completely, over the last 2 years, changed in terms of the seriousness of the CO2 footprint that they have. And this is part of all our big companies that we are dealing with today. That is part of the quotation, how were going to handle that and how we can help them with that. And there, Im confident that we will do a fantastic job. So a lot of innovation around that. And then if I can use an example that when entered into the vacuum industrial vacuum space, and at the time, we didnt see a lot of innovation. It seemed like even from myself, I said there was the old pumps being sold over and over again. And of course, now we have variable speed. We have changed the packaging on products and in a fairly short period of time, and we have managed to be from 2, 3 to 1 in this. And of course, when they had this map on different technologies, one of these areas is also the industrial pumps where we can see that theres not much going on in terms of innovation. And of course, we are beginning, so we have respect for that, but its one of those areas where you can see that we can bring both connectivity and other parts to that as well. In Henriks space, I think its extremely interesting and also challenging for Henrik to go from a standard product, to go to the flexible automation. Because if you do it if you go to a customer, you say well, normally say that you should always listen to your customers and you say, Mr. CustomerMs. Customer, what would you like to have? And then youre going to get, well, I want this like this, and I want this green button to here, and this should come in from this way, and the logistics should work this way and you need to adapt your software to work like this. So and then youre going to have a business that will not be so profitable. The trick here for us is to work modularization, to making sure that we can go to the customer to say, okay, this is the end result. And we suggest this box together with this box and work with this box and then we do a little bit finetuning in terms of what you want, but that is certainly to go into this field, of course. As we dont build a new product every time. So that were working quite a lot on. Recycling, I think it was mentioned by you. Its a new area for us, and its hydrogen, but there are a lot of other materials that you could recycle in those processes. So we are looking into that as well. And then I mentioned it already that we like to get away from the diesel in many of the applications. We are at electric. And of course, we can do battery as well, which is inaudible from pneumatic to electric to battery. I think a lot of the tools handling are batterydriven today. So those are some of the areas that we focus on. I dont know, maybe this gentleman can add on what they focus on. GEERT FOLLENS: What we see very much is that in the semiconductor industry, I mentioned it in the presentation, processes are getting harsher, which means basically 2 things. You have more nasty material that has to go through the pump and they are running at much higher temperatures. And while you manage those 2, you still have to continue to do the dust handling of particles that come through the pump. And I we made a lot of progress on increasing the temperature, improving the dust handling while we reduce the energy consumption. And then on the abatements, I mean most of our customers are really challenging us to limit. And I mentioned NOx, but anything now because they want to be seen as a clean chips producer, and therefore, you need to innovate constantly. So I would say dust handling and harsh processes and constant new regulations from an exhaust point of view drive the innovation for Vacuum Technique. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Good, sounds exciting. Klas? KLAS HENRIK BERGELIND: Question for you, Henrik. Just a couple of final followup. So the competitive position in automotive through battery electric, it really feels like that has strengthened. I mean if I look at some of the Asian players, Japanese, they dont have the kind of offering that you have. So would you say that in automotive, through battery electric, that your market share really has gone up? It looks like it. We just want to listen to you around the competitive positioning. HENRIK ELMIN: I would agree. I see we have started early working with the leaders here. At the same time, weve had the pandemic, so to have these strong local teams close to customers in Korea, U.S. and other markets, I think, has really helped. So I would say it depends, of course, per technology. We have a broad portfolio, but I would say the same, more higher market share if you compare with combustion engine vehicles, yes. KLAS HENRIK BERGELIND: Then just a quick followup on the growth, MA versus organic. I mean you literally have access to all assembly lines out there. You want to expand the time further on the vision side. You say new growth verticals that is in glass and solar. There are opportunities in inspection around painting, assembly side gas decarbonization, traceable fasteners in winter, so much growth opportunities organically. And well listen, obviously, on the industrial pump side, there is well, on the side in VT on the industrial side, there is more MA. You havent talked that much about MA. So I mean this is really about growing off the ISRA and Perceptron platform? Or do you have a specific MA agenda as well? Thats really my question. HENRIK ELMIN: All the divisions, also in Industrial Technique, have on their mission to also drive MA. But of course with what we have now with machine vision and the things I showed, there is a very, I think, good opportunity on the organic side, but its both. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Next question. UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: inaudible from JPMorgan Asset Management. I was hoping you can maybe elaborate a little bit on the concept of modularization that you just mentioned. Perhaps explain to us in kind of which specific area you are working on that concept. What is currently the percentage of your lines or product lines, which are operating at that level? And in terms of the productivity or perhaps throughput in terms of new product coming to the market, how much do you expect that modularization kind of process to improve that? MATS RAHMSTRM: Okay. I think the leaders for us is the division for Industrial Air. They have been really prof just in time, which they are canalized to right now, but also building module system. So to build up the justintime, they have had to drive themselves through modularization and youve been there more than me. But I would say that, that is modules that they assemble all the time. In Henriks case, the tools are also very module, the heads and the pieces, and that has been the structure been in place for over 10 years, I think. So a lot of that, I would say, is 100 modernization. And maybe you can comment yourself, Henrik? HENRIK ELMIN: What we do, if I take first the industrial side, so we have the 3 main brands, which is Atlas Copco Edwards labels. Before the acquisitions, of course, they developed all their own products. Now that we own the 3 brands, we kind of streamlined the innovation. So we use as many modular parts or core parts, which are the same, and then we tune the machine for a specific application. So and thats where I refer to the service, basically the core of the machine has developed once and is then used for the 3 brands. So thats how we work in industrial. In semiconductor, its slightly different. We have standard components but depending on the customers process. Say they go from logic to memory, if you would take a Korean customer here, we have to change modules. So you have a primary pump, secondary pump abatement. So what we have developed our systems now so that we have standard interfaces. So if the customer decides to change the process, you can do it within the same system, but maybe change 1 or 2 of the modules in the whole vacuum system. And that creates enormous flexibility for the customer and gives us the opportunity to really add value for the customer in that way. MATS RAHMSTRM: I dont have a number in terms of where we really are, but there is significant potential still to continue to work with the modularization. And talking modularization, its not a standard for the customer. Wed really like to give the customer a lot of different options for what they want, but to be able to do that and drive profitability, you need to find ways to modularize and how we make our setup. And I think you mentioned another example, Geert, during your presentation, when you talked about the serviceability of products that some of the cores are similar and then the division make them unique then for their specific brands. Thats another way for us to be efficient. And I should also say that we also we back out of businesses that are more projectbased, more labor, more steel. Customers want us to provide a lot more than we do, but we are gladly handing that over to someone else. Its very low margins on lot of these and a lot of risks. For example, in the car, the line builders type of industry, we are not going to get into that. Thats a lot of specials there. DANIEL ALTHOFF: Okay. I think that concludes the QA session.

Intel announced Tuesday it will build two new factories in Arizona and outsource more of its production as a new CEO looks to turnaround the struggling chipmaker. The Californiabased company says the Arizona expansion will cost about 20 billion and create 3,000 permanent jobs as Intel builds a foundry business to provide chips for other firms. More construction in the United States, Europe and elsewhere could be announced over the next year, CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a video outlining his vision for the companys transformation. The unprecedented demand for technology has created even more need for the innovative products Intel creates, Keyvan Esfarjani, Intels senior vice president of manufacturing and operations, told reporters outside the companys plant in Chandler, Arizona. Intel dominated chipmaking for decades but has stumbled lately with delays in its development of a nextgeneration chipmaking process already in use by a major Taiwan supplier, TSMC. It has struggled to adapt to the shift from personal computers to mobile devices since Apple released its gamechanging iPhone more than a decade ago. Although the company has remained profitable, its heyday during the PC era was long ago. Intel weathered another blow last year when Apple, also based in California, announced it would rely on its own chips to power its Mac computers instead of Intels. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey called Intels growth plan the largest privatesector investment in state history and a victory for U.S. manufacturing. Lets bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States, Ducey said. And while were at it, lets bring it back to Arizona. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is also planning a large factory in North Phoenix. Intel has a history of making splashy announcements that dont immediately pan out. A decade ago, the company announced plans to build a new multibilliondollar factory in Chandler while President Barack Obama visited Intels plant in Hillsboro, Oregon. That facility, known as Fab 42, was put on ice for years, was announced again alongside President Donald Trump in 2017 and finally opened late last year. The company, which earned nearly 21 billion last year on revenue of 78 billion, is eligible for up to 90 million in state tax credits if it fulfils the job and investment commitments it made Tuesday, said Sandra Watson, head of the Arizona Commerce Authority, the states economic development agency. State lawmakers on Monday rushed through legislation to more than double the funding available for the program, which Ducey signed into law hours before Intels announcement. Intel began operations in Arizona in 1980, when it established its facility in West Chandler. It later expanded to a second campus several miles away in the sprawling suburbs Ocotillo region.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

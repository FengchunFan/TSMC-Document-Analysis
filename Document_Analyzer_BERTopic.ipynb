Last month, the company said the second plant wouldn't produce chips until 2027 or 2028, rather than 2026, citing uncertainty about tech choices and federal funding.\\n  Progress at the Arizona site partly depends on ''how much incentives that the U.S. government can provide,'' Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said in an investor call.\\n  TSMC is just one of several chip makers running into obstacles with their U.S. expansion plans. Intel, Microchip Technology and others have also adjusted their production schedules, as a sales slump in many kinds of chips pressures the companies to manage their spending on new infrastructure. New chip factories are hugely complex, involving thousands of construction workers, long construction timelines and billions of dollars of machinery.\\n  The delays come as the Biden administration begins dispensing the first major awards from a $39 billion pot of money aimed at building up the U.S. semiconductor industry and reducing the nation's dependence on technology manufactured in East Asia. On Monday, the administration said it would award $1.5 billion in grants to the chipmaker GlobalFoundries to upgrade and expand facilities in New York and Vermont that make chips for automakers and the defense industry.\\n  But the issues that companies like TSMC face with their projects could undercut this fanfare, raising questions about the prospects of success for President Biden's industrial policy program. The investments are expected to figure heavily in Mr. Biden's re-election campaign over the next few months.\\n  ''Nothing has failed yet,'' said Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow and the director of the energy, economics and security program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. ''But we're going to have to see some progress and those factories actually coming online in the next few years for the program to be considered a success.''\\n  The Commerce Department is responsible for handing out federal money from the 2022 CHIPS Act to spur domestic chip production. In addition to the grant to GlobalFoundries, the department has issued two small production grants so far. It is expected to give much larger awards in the billions of dollars to chipmakers like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron in the coming weeks and months.\\n  The government is locked in complex negotiations with these major chipmakers over the amount and timing of the awards. Companies are also still waiting for guidance from the Treasury Department about which investments will qualify for a new tax credit aimed at advanced manufacturing, which had been expected before the end of 2023.\\n  Any delays in the process could hurt the United States as it races to reduce global dependence on chip factories in Taiwan, South Korea and China, analysts said. Rival countries are offering their own incentives to court chip manufacturers. TSMC, for example, plans to add production in Japan and Germany as well as in the United States.\\n  The longer the U.S. government waits to distribute benefits, ''the more other geographies are going to snap up these investments, and more leading-edge investments will be made in East Asia,'' said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser for technology analysis to the RAND Corporation. ''So the clock is ticking.''\\n  A Commerce Department official disputed suggestions that it had been slow in handing out incentives. He said the department was taking time to protect taxpayer interests and push companies to do more to bolster the domestic chip supply chain.\\n  A White House official said the chip companies' schedule changes were minor adjustments that were common at complex projects like the new production sites. He added that forecasts suggested there would be overwhelming demand for these chips when the facilities started making them.\\n  A Treasury Department spokeswoman said that officials there had provided clarity on tax credits to companies planning investments and were working to issue additional guidance as quickly as possible.\\n  The CHIPS Act authorized grants and other incentives to boost U.S. chip production, plus tax credits for investments in factories and manufacturing equipment. More than 600 companies and organizations had submitted statements of interest in the grants, the Commerce Department said, while it estimates pledges of private investment so far at $235 billion.\\n  But most expansion plans were set when chips were scarce several years ago, after a pandemic-fueled burst of consumer spending on electronic products. That demand dried up, leaving chip makers stuck with big inventories of unsold components and little immediate need for new factories.\\n  ''Companies are rethinking how and what and when investments will occur,'' said Thomas Sonderman, the chief executive of SkyWater Technology, a Minnesota chip manufacturer that has won Defense Department subsidies and is aiming for CHIPS Act funding.\\n  One chip maker feeling the pinch is Microchip, an Arizona company. Two years ago, Microchip was swamped with orders. It applied for CHIPS Act funding to stoke production and stands to receive $162 million. Yet as sales have slumped, it recently announced two separate two-week factory shutdowns.\\n  Microchip still plans to upgrade its factories in Oregon and Colorado that are set to receive CHIPS Act grants, said Ganesh Moorthy, its chief executive. But ordering machines to increase production capacity will have to wait until business conditions improve.\\n  ''We've paused on expansion,'' Mr. Moorthy said.\\n  Intel, which is expanding production, has also adjusted purchases of costly factory tools. The company recently said it didn't expect to start manufacturing in Ohio, where it is spending $20 billion on two new factories, in 2025 as it originally expected. The change was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.\\n  Still, Intel said neither construction on that site, nor plans to expand in the United States and three other countries, had slowed.\\n  ''The strategy is not changing from quarter to quarter,'' said Keyvan Esfarjani, the executive vice president who oversees Intel's manufacturing operations. ''We're staying on course.''\\n  Some chip makers, such as Texas Instruments and Micron Technology, are plowing forward with expanding chip production for competitive reasons. New factories can help make higher-quality chips, more of them and for cheaper.\\n  Micron is pushing ahead with building a $15 billion factory in Boise, Idaho, its hometown, and plans an even bigger manufacturing complex near Syracuse, N.Y., despite a downturn in the market for its memory chips, which store data in devices like smartphones and computers.\\n  Scott Gatzemeier, a Micron vice president overseeing the expansion, said construction projects that took several years should be based on future chip demand rather than current conditions. Renting massive cranes and other equipment and securing construction workers, he added, are big expenses that might need to be repeated if a project is halted.\\n  ''Once you start, you don't want to stop,'' he said.\\n  Other chip makers are unwilling to start construction without government money. Mr. Sonderman of SkyWater, for example, said his company's plans for a $1.8 billion facility in Indiana are contingent on obtaining funds through a portion of the CHIPS Act targeting research.\\n  At TSMC's Arizona site, unforeseen problems have piled up over the past year.\\n  Last summer, construction unions in the state raised issues about workplace safety and objected to TSMC's bringing workers from Taiwan to help install sophisticated equipment in the first factory. Delays in installing machines led to an announcement in July about the production delay.\\n  In December, TSMC and the Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council agreed on ground rules at the site for safety, workplace training, site staffing and other issues. In an emailed statement, Mr. Liu, who recently announced plans to retire, sounded hopeful that worker tensions were over.\\n  He acknowledged ''challenges'' in building the first Phoenix factory, but said TSMC was still ''the fastest player'' among its peers in completing such projects. While he told analysts in January that the company would delay the start of production at the second factory, also known as a fab, worker skills aren't likely to be among the reasons.\\n  ''We believe the construction of our second fab will be much smoother,'' Mr. Liu said. ''The workers in Arizona learn things quickly.''\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/technology/semiconductor-chip-factories-delays.html\\nGraphic\\nPHOTO: In 2022, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company held an event in Arizona to announce it planned to spend $40 billion on its first major U.S. hub for chip manufacturing.

Last month, the company said the second plant wouldn't produce chips until 2027 or 2028, rather than 2026, citing uncertainty about tech choices and federal funding.\\n  Progress at the Arizona site partly depends on ''how much incentives that the U.S. government can provide,'' Mark Liu, TSMC's chairman, said in an investor call.\\n  TSMC is just one of several chip makers running into obstacles with their U.S. expansion plans. Intel, Microchip Technology and others have also adjusted their production schedules, as a sales slump in many kinds of chips pressures the companies to manage their spending on new infrastructure. New chip factories are hugely complex, involving thousands of construction workers, long construction timelines and billions of dollars of machinery.\\n  The delays come as the Biden administration begins dispensing the first major awards from a $39 billion pot of money aimed at building up the U.S. semiconductor industry and reducing the nation's dependence on technology manufactured in East Asia. On Monday, the administration said it would award $1.5 billion in grants to the chipmaker GlobalFoundries to upgrade and expand facilities in New York and Vermont that make chips for automakers and the defense industry.\\n  But the issues that companies like TSMC face with their projects could undercut this fanfare, raising questions about the prospects of success for President Biden's industrial policy program. The investments are expected to figure heavily in Mr. Biden's re-election campaign over the next few months.\\n  ''Nothing has failed yet,'' said Emily Kilcrease, a senior fellow and the director of the energy, economics and security program at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. ''But we're going to have to see some progress and those factories actually coming online in the next few years for the program to be considered a success.''\\n  The Commerce Department is responsible for handing out federal money from the 2022 CHIPS Act to spur domestic chip production. In addition to the grant to GlobalFoundries, the department has issued two small production grants so far. It is expected to give much larger awards in the billions of dollars to chipmakers like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron in the coming weeks and months.\\n  The government is locked in complex negotiations with these major chipmakers over the amount and timing of the awards. Companies are also still waiting for guidance from the Treasury Department about which investments will qualify for a new tax credit aimed at advanced manufacturing, which had been expected before the end of 2023.\\n  Any delays in the process could hurt the United States as it races to reduce global dependence on chip factories in Taiwan, South Korea and China, analysts said. Rival countries are offering their own incentives to court chip manufacturers. TSMC, for example, plans to add production in Japan and Germany as well as in the United States.\\n  The longer the U.S. government waits to distribute benefits, ''the more other geographies are going to snap up these investments, and more leading-edge investments will be made in East Asia,'' said Jimmy Goodrich, a senior adviser for technology analysis to the RAND Corporation. ''So the clock is ticking.''\\n  A Commerce Department official disputed suggestions that it had been slow in handing out incentives. He said the department was taking time to protect taxpayer interests and push companies to do more to bolster the domestic chip supply chain.\\n  A White House official said the chip companies' schedule changes were minor adjustments that were common at complex projects like the new production sites. He added that forecasts suggested there would be overwhelming demand for these chips when the facilities started making them.\\n  A Treasury Department spokeswoman said that officials there had provided clarity on tax credits to companies planning investments and were working to issue additional guidance as quickly as possible.\\n  The CHIPS Act authorized grants and other incentives to boost U.S. chip production, plus tax credits for investments in factories and manufacturing equipment. More than 600 companies and organizations had submitted statements of interest in the grants, the Commerce Department said, while it estimates pledges of private investment so far at $235 billion.\\n  But most expansion plans were set when chips were scarce several years ago, after a pandemic-fueled burst of consumer spending on electronic products. That demand dried up, leaving chip makers stuck with big inventories of unsold components and little immediate need for new factories.\\n  ''Companies are rethinking how and what and when investments will occur,'' said Thomas Sonderman, the chief executive of SkyWater Technology, a Minnesota chip manufacturer that has won Defense Department subsidies and is aiming for CHIPS Act funding.\\n  One chip maker feeling the pinch is Microchip, an Arizona company. Two years ago, Microchip was swamped with orders. It applied for CHIPS Act funding to stoke production and stands to receive $162 million. Yet as sales have slumped, it recently announced two separate two-week factory shutdowns.\\n  Microchip still plans to upgrade its factories in Oregon and Colorado that are set to receive CHIPS Act grants, said Ganesh Moorthy, its chief executive. But ordering machines to increase production capacity will have to wait until business conditions improve.\\n  ''We've paused on expansion,'' Mr. Moorthy said.\\n  Intel, which is expanding production, has also adjusted purchases of costly factory tools. The company recently said it didn't expect to start manufacturing in Ohio, where it is spending $20 billion on two new factories, in 2025 as it originally expected. The change was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.\\n  Still, Intel said neither construction on that site, nor plans to expand in the United States and three other countries, had slowed.\\n  ''The strategy is not changing from quarter to quarter,'' said Keyvan Esfarjani, the executive vice president who oversees Intel's manufacturing operations. ''We're staying on course.''\\n  Some chip makers, such as Texas Instruments and Micron Technology, are plowing forward with expanding chip production for competitive reasons. New factories can help make higher-quality chips, more of them and for cheaper.\\n  Micron is pushing ahead with building a $15 billion factory in Boise, Idaho, its hometown, and plans an even bigger manufacturing complex near Syracuse, N.Y., despite a downturn in the market for its memory chips, which store data in devices like smartphones and computers.\\n  Scott Gatzemeier, a Micron vice president overseeing the expansion, said construction projects that took several years should be based on future chip demand rather than current conditions. Renting massive cranes and other equipment and securing construction workers, he added, are big expenses that might need to be repeated if a project is halted.\\n  ''Once you start, you don't want to stop,'' he said.\\n  Other chip makers are unwilling to start construction without government money. Mr. Sonderman of SkyWater, for example, said his company's plans for a $1.8 billion facility in Indiana are contingent on obtaining funds through a portion of the CHIPS Act targeting research.\\n  At TSMC's Arizona site, unforeseen problems have piled up over the past year.\\n  Last summer, construction unions in the state raised issues about workplace safety and objected to TSMC's bringing workers from Taiwan to help install sophisticated equipment in the first factory. Delays in installing machines led to an announcement in July about the production delay.\\n  In December, TSMC and the Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council agreed on ground rules at the site for safety, workplace training, site staffing and other issues. In an emailed statement, Mr. Liu, who recently announced plans to retire, sounded hopeful that worker tensions were over.\\n  He acknowledged ''challenges'' in building the first Phoenix factory, but said TSMC was still ''the fastest player'' among its peers in completing such projects. While he told analysts in January that the company would delay the start of production at the second factory, also known as a fab, worker skills aren't likely to be among the reasons.\\n  ''We believe the construction of our second fab will be much smoother,'' Mr. Liu said. ''The workers in Arizona learn things quickly.''\\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/technology/semiconductor-chip-factories-delays.html\\nGraphic\\nPHOTO: In 2022, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company held an event in Arizona to announce it planned to spend $40 billion on its first major U.S. hub for chip manufacturing.

Subsequently, the companys management will host a call to address those results at 5:00 p.m. ET. Currently, SP Capital IQ Consensus expects the ecommerce pet products provider to report Q1 EPS of 0.17 and revenues of 1.53 bln, which would represent an increase of approx. 38 yryr. That revenue estimate exceeds the companys own guidance slightly in its Q4 press in early April, Chewy guided for Q1 net sales growth of 3537 yryr, or 1.501.52 bln in sales. The companys Q1 results pertain to the three months ended May 3, meaning that much of the quarter was impacted by the COVID19 pandemic and its associated disruptions to consumer lifestyle and spending habits. In its Q4 report, Chewy observed that \\\"concerned pet parents\\\" had engaged in stockpiling pet care necessities during the pandemic and that, in keeping with social distancing guidelines, they had shifted their shopping to online channels to do so the company had seen an acceleration in sales dating back to late February. That volume acceleration included increased participation from existing customers the company had 13.5 mln active customers as of the end of Q4 as well as a \\\"meaningful lift in new customers.\\\" Higher pet adoption trends were observed to be spurring a \\\"healthy uptick on the hard goods side.\\\" Chewy cautioned that the \\\"high operational tempo\\\" it would sustain in order to \\\"meet peak demand periods\\\" could impact efficiency on the fulfillment side, and it noted that it could see demand moderate in the wake of consumer stockpiling and as the pandemic abates. Chewy also mentioned that it aimed to hire up to 10,000 more personnel, primarily in its fulfillment centers, to handle backlog during this period. The company has not offered Q1 profit guidance. Todays report will mark Chewys fifth quarterly financial release since going public last June. The company has never yet surpassed expectations on the bottom line. Meanwhile, its revenue results have been inline with estimates or better in every quarter todate. Looking forward, for Q2, SP Capital IQ Consensus expects Chewy to report a loss per share of 0.15 and revenues of 1.55 bln. Last quarter, the company did not guide for the full year. Should it opt to offer a fullyear outlook today, that guidance will compare to SP Capital IQ Consensus estimates for fullyear EPS of 0.46 and revenues of 6.41 bln. CHWY has a valuation of circa 4.37 bln it has yet to achieve profitability. Currently, the stock, which has outperformed the broader market during the pandemic as a staples provider and as an expected beneficiary of increased ecommerce penetration, today reached new record highs, up approx. 79 yeartodate. 11:49 SCANX StocksETFs that traded to new 52 week highslows this session New highs 18 outpacing new lows 0 Technical Stocks that traded to 52 week highs: AAPL, AAXN, ADBE, AMZN, CLW, CWH, FMCI, HD, KNSL, SNAP, SNPS, SRPT, SWBI, SWN, TTD, UTHR, VAPO, YMAB, HCI ETFs that traded to 52 week highs: FDN, IGV, IYH, QQQ, RTH 11:46 SUMRX Economic Summary Economic Data Summary: May NFIB Small Business Optimism Index 94.4 prior was 90.9 Apr JOLTS Job Openings 5.046 mln prior was revised to 6.011 mln from 6.191 mlnApr Wholesale Inventories 0.3 vs Briefing.com consensus of 0.4 prior was revised to 1.1 from 0.8 Upcoming Economic Data: 0606 MBA Mortgage Applications Index due out Wed at 7 ET prior was 3.9 May CPI due out Wed at 8:30 ET Briefing.com consensus of 0.0 prior was 0.8 May Core CPI due out Wed at 8:30 ET Briefing.com consensus of 0.0 prior was 0.4 Jun FOMC Rate Decision due out Wed at 14:00 ET Briefing.com consensus of 0.125 prior was 0.125 11:43 SOXX Industry Briefing: Chipmakers 271.25 0.40 The PHLX Semiconductor Index 0.2 is having a better showing than the broader market today after underperforming on Monday.

The Phase 1b multicenter trial will test the hypothesis that combination immunotherapy with the DPV001 cancer vaccine and antiOX40 will augment anticancer immunity in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer. Triple Negative Breast Cancer is negative for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and HER2 receptors, and therefore treatment options are limited. This type of breast cancer tends to metastasize frequently, and occur in younger patients less than 50 years of age and those with the inherited BRCA1 mutation.This is the first clinical trial to combine a cancer vaccine DPV001, that educates the immune system to destroy cancer cells, with a T cell agonist, Bristol Myers Squibbs antiOX40 BMS986178, that amplifies immune system activity. Patients also will receive antiprogrammed death 1 immune checkpoint therapy, Bristol Myers Squibbs Opdivo, which takes the brakes off the immune system. 11:05 AMC AMC Entertainment First Quarter Earnings Preview 5.93 0.51 Theater giant AMC Entertainment is slated to release Q1 results tonight with a conference call to follow at 5 p.m. ET.As it stands, the Capital IQ Consensus Estimate sees Q1 EPS of 1.44 vs 1.25 a year ago on sales declines of 21 to about 947.06 mln.On June 3 AMC gave downside guidance for Q1 Mar revs of 941.5 mln.Further, the company expects a Q1 Net Loss between 2,117.3 million and 2,417.3 million, based on an impairment charge related to estimated long lived assets, indefinitelived intangible assets and goodwill of 1,800.0 million to 2,100.0 million, compared to a net loss of 130.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Just a few days ago 63 AMC announced the reopening of Odeon Cinemas in Oslo, Norway, the first reopening for AMCs cinema properties worldwide.The company tried its hand at a 5050 policy on March 16, but locations quickly shut down across the nation as stayathome orders percolated in all of its major footholds. Formally, on March 17 the company announced the closure of all of its locations for a period of 612 weeks.Shares have gradually climbed higher these past few months, helped along by rumors in midMay of a potential Amazon AMZN buyout.The rumor mill also suggested that AMC would potentially need to declare bankruptcy or consider restructuring its debt to stay afloat amid the closure of all of its locations across the world. AMC didnt comment on this specifically, but wed highlight that AMC had roughly 265.0 in cash on hand with about 4.75 bln in corporate debt as of Dec. 31, 2019.On April 29 the company filed to delay its 10K and 10Q reports to the SEC citing the substantial disruption in the Companys operations from COVID19 including the suspension of all theater operations worldwide resulting in the cessation of essentially all revenues.Also on April 29 the company announced that it would no longer license any Universal Studios CMCSA movies in any of its 1,000 theaters on the terms that the company would offer directtohome releases.

Peers Marcus MCS and National Cinemedia NCMI have begun plans to reopen locations across their portfolios. For now, the company has staved off a Chapter 11 filing, but its probably too early to make a definitive call given the modest reopening efforts. 10:58 TALKX Market Briefing: Megacap support holding losses in check The major indices are being dialed back some after yesterdays session in particular phoned in reports of speculative excess.

Losses would be greater without the support of the megacap stocks, but they are all nicely bid at the moment. That is making a big difference and is helping to offset the noticeable weakness in the energy 3.3, financial 2.6, and industrials 1.9 sectors, which have been drivers of the recent cyclicallycharged rally. It also goes to show that investors arent giving up on the stock market at this juncture, as money rotates within it as opposed to rotating away from it in wholesale fashion. The Nasdaq Composite is up 0.2 the SP 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.6 and the Russell 2000 is down 2.2. 10:28 IYT Industry Briefing: Transports 173.89 4.69 The Dow Jones Transportation Average 2.7 displays relative weakness as the broader market pulls back after its recent rally. The DJTA was at the forefront of the markets advance, so it is somewhat fitting that the highbeta group is also pacing the markets pullback. The DJTA has narrowed its June gain to 9.0 versus a 7.5 monthtodate gain in the Dow 1.0 and a 5.2 monthtodate gain in the SP 500 1.0.

The U.S. government played a significant role in the development of semiconductor technology, and domestic research and production have long been matters of intense congressional interest. U.S.headquartered semiconductor firms accounted for about half of worldwide semiconductor sales in 2015.1 However, U.S.headquartered producers face stiff competition from firms headquartered in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan moreover, the Chinese government has identified global leadership in semiconductors as a national priority. Further, the United States accounts for a diminishing share of global semiconductor production capacity, as manufacturers establish plants in locations where generous subsidies are available or customers in user industries, such as electronic products manufacturing, are nearby. In July 2015, Members of Congress concerned about the industrys competitiveness formed a Semiconductor Caucus to support increased federal funding for semiconductor research activities, among other objectives. Semiconductor Industry Basics A semiconductor chip also known simply as a semiconductor or chip is a tiny electronic device generally smaller than a postage stamp comprised of billions of components that store, move, and process data. These functions are made possible by the unique properties of semiconducting materials, such as silicon and germanium, which allow for the precise control of the flow of electrical current. Semiconductors are the enabling technology of the information age. Semiconductors allow computers to run software applications, such as email, Internet browsers, and word processing and spreadsheet programs and to store documents, photographs, videos, music, and other data. They also provide the brains, memory, and data communication capabilities of countless other products, from cell phones and gaming systems to aircraft and industrial machinery to military equipment and weapons. Even many products with roots in mechanical systems are now heavily dependent on chipbased electronics: one car manufacturer asserts that some of its models incorporate as many as 6,000 semiconductors. And one expert on software in cars estimates that premiumclass automobiles can contain close to 100 million lines of software code instructions that the chips use to control the vehicle. Source: Congressional Research Service https:fas.orgsgpcrsmiscR44544.pdf World Semiconductor Trade Statistics The Chapters of the four world regions appoint 13 directors who form the Board of Directors supervision. Each region nominates a Vice Chairman who together with the Chairman forms the Executive Commitee operational steering. The Chairman is elected by the Committee, the assembly of representatives of all member companies. WSTS has two salaried employees, the Administrator and the Assistant to Administrator. The four regions Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific have regional organizations of WSTS member companies, the so called Chapters . Chapters meet regularly and develop policies and proposals for the operation of WSTS. In addition the Chapters appoint their representatives in the Board of Directors and elect a Vice Chairman , who represents the respective region in the Executive Committee . The Chairman of the Executive Committe however is elected by the Committee, which in turn is composed of one representative of each member company. The tenure of WSTS officers is 18 month. Reelection for a second period is possible. Communication between these various functions happens by correspondence, through this Internet Portal and by meetings. Chapters meet two to four times a year, the Board of Directors convenes twice a year in May and October and the Executive Committe meets at least twice a year, too. Also the Committee has two meetings per year, normally cotimed and colocated with the venue of the Board of Directors and the Executive Commitee. Obviously the Chapter meetings take place in the respective region, whereas all other meetings with worldwide participation rotate among the regions. The currently established practice is that spring meetings alternate between Japan and Asia Pacific, whereas autumn meetings alternate between Americas and Europe. This scheme provides equitable opportunities for all Committee members to participate. WSTS cooperates closely with the regional Semiconductor Industry Associations. These organizations participate as observers in all major meetings and provide an alternative feedback channel from the semiconductor industry, supplementary to the information that is brought in by the company representatives in the Committee. Semiconductor industry organizations hold also distribution licenses for WSTS reports and thereby provide a commercial distribution channel for these reports to nonsemiconductor companies and organizations. As WSTS collects revenue data from competitors it is mandatory that such data is compiled and consolidated by Data Collection Agents before this data is conveyed to WSTS for the generation of statistic reports. In order to provide best protection to individual member companies trade data, WSTS uses three Data Collection Agents, one for consolidation of Japanese member companies data, one for consolidation of Europe member companies data and another one who consolidates the data of all Asia Pacific and Americas companies. The latter Data Collection Agent also performs the worldwide consolidation of the data from the regions. Data Collection Agents have the typical professional qualification of certified public accountants and are service providers to both the member companies and WSTS in an arm length relationship. The WSTS employees, the Administrator and the Assistant to Administrator are responsible for the operation of all WSTS programs, for the publication of all reports and any other content of this Internet Portal, for the organization of meetings, for member services and for the financial management of the WSTS.

Selected Operating Data In this press release, we provide EBITDA, which is not defined by U.S. GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA to be relevant and useful information to our investors because it provides additional information in assessing our financial operating results. Our management uses EBITDA in evaluating our operating performance, our ability to service debt and our ability to fund capital expenditures. However, EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not reflect the impact of certain expenses on our consolidated statements of income, including interest expense, which is a necessary element of our costs because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations, income tax expense, which is a necessary element of our costs because taxes are imposed by law, and depreciation and amortization, which is a necessary element of our costs because we use capital assets to generate income. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, operating income, net income or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Furthermore our definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Below is our reconciliation of EBITDA to U.S. GAAP net income. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 201602, Leases Topic 842. Upon adoption, we recorded a rightofuse asset and lease liability on our balance sheet.

CHANDLER, Arizona May 7, 2019 NASDAQ: MCHP Microchip Technology Incorporated, a leading semiconductor supplier of smart, connected and secure embedded control solutions, today reported results for the three months and fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 as summarized in the following table: GAAP and NonGAAP net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 were 1.330 billion, up 32.7 from net sales of 1.002 billion in the prior years fourth fiscal quarter. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was 174.7 million, or 0.70 per diluted share, up from GAAP net income of 146.7 million, or 0.58 per diluted share, in the prior years fourth fiscal quarter. The current years GAAP net income was significantly adversely impacted by purchase accounting adjustments associated with our acquisitions. NonGAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was 370.4 million, or 1.48 per diluted share, up 5.4 from nonGAAP net income of 351.3 million, or 1.40 per diluted share, in the prior years fourth fiscal quarter. For the fourth quarters of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, our nonGAAP results exclude the effect of sharebased compensation, expenses related to our acquisition activities including intangible asset amortization, inventory valuation costs, excess capacity charges to normalize acquired inventory levels, severance and other restructuring costs, and legal and other general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions, noncash interest expense on our convertible debentures, adjustments for a manufacturing excursion issue with one of our suppliers, losses on the settlement of debt, and losses and impairments on availableforsale investments. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, our nonGAAP income tax expense is presented based on projected cash taxes for fiscal 2019, excluding transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, our nonGAAP income tax expense is presented in a manner that excludes the tax impact of nonGAAP adjustments calculated using the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions where the adjustments occurred, tax adjustments in accordance with ASC 740270, and onetime tax events. A reconciliation of our nonGAAP and GAAP results is included in this press release. GAAP net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were 5.350 billion, an increase of 34.4 from net sales of 3.981 billion in the prior fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, consolidated net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was 355.9 million, or 1.42 per diluted share, an increase of 39.4 from net income of 255.4 million, or 1.03 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year. The current years GAAP net income was significantly adversely impacted by purchase accounting adjustments associated with our acquisitions. The prior years GAAP net income results were significantly adversely impacted by onetime tax adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. NonGAAP net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 were 5.476 billion, an increase of 37.6 from net sales of 3.981 billion in the prior fiscal year. On a nonGAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 was 1.636 billion, or 6.55 per diluted share, an increase of 20.7 from net income of 1,355.6 million, or 5.45 per diluted share, in the prior fiscal year. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we reported nonGAAP net sales based on endmarket demand, which excluded the effect of our distributors increasing or decreasing their inventory holdings. Beginning with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we changed the information included in our financial guidance and provide net sales guidance based on sellin revenue recognition under the new GAAP standard. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, our nonGAAP results are calculated as the sum of the nonGAAP results we disclosed previously for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 plus the nonGAAP results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 based on sellin revenue recognition. See the \\\"Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures\\\" section of this release. Beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019, we changed the information included in our financial guidance. Please refer to the \\\"First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Outlook\\\" section of this release for details regarding our revised approach to providing guidance. Microchip announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a record quarterly cash dividend on its common stock of 36.55 cents per share. The quarterly dividend is payable on June 4, 2019 to stockholders of record on May 21, 2019. \\\"Our March quarter financial results were very good in spite of a challenging economic backdrop,\\\" said Steve Sanghi, Chief Executive Officer. \\\"Our net sales came in above the midpoint of our narrowed guidance range that we issued on March 5, 2019. Our GAAP and nonGAAP gross margin percentage were above the highend of our guidance and our operating expenses as a percentage of sales were below the lowend of our guidance. As a result, our operating margins were well above the highend of our guidance, reflecting the strength of our business model.\\\" Mr. Sanghi added, \\\"Endmarket demand, which reflects sellthrough activities in the distribution channel, was 10.4 million higher than GAAP sellin revenue in the March 2019 quarter. As a result, distribution inventory declined from 36 days to 35 days. We believe that barring any negative development on the U.S. China trade front, our distributors are carrying a reasonable level of inventory to support endmarket demand.\\\" \\\"Last month Gartner reported their microcontroller market share data for calendar year 2018. We are pleased to report that we expanded our market share in 8bit, 16bit and 32bit microcontrollers and grew faster in all three product categories when compared to our large competitors in these markets,\\\" said Ganesh Moorthy, President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Moorthy added, \\\"The integration of Microsemi with Microchip continues to progress at a rapid pace. We are achieving synergies in the business units, sales, operations and support functions, while we relentlessly march toward the longterm synergy targets we have outlined for our stockholders.\\\" Eric Bjornholt, Microchips Chief Financial Officer, said, \\\"We paid down 277.5 million of total debt during the March quarter, reflecting a cumulative pay down of 1.156 billion over the last nine months, as we continued to tightly manage our working capital requirements for the business. We will continue to use substantially all of our excess cash generation after dividends to reduce the amount of debt on our balance sheet as quickly as possible.\\\" Mr. Sanghi added, \\\"Last quarter we said that barring any negative development on the trade front, we expected the March 2019 quarter to mark the bottom of this cycle for Microchip. Secondly, we said last quarter that we did not know the shape of the recovery and it would depend somewhat on the outcome of the trade talks. Towards that end, the U.S. did not get a settlement on the trade front. In fact, in recent days, the rhetoric has turned more negative with 25 duties on 200 billion of Chinese goods expected to go into effect this Friday. Therefore, the uncertainty related to U.S. China trade relations continues.\\\" Mr. Sanghi concluded, \\\"Given the continued uncertainty, we expect weaker than seasonal business conditions for Microchip. We continue to operate our business prudently for longterm shareholder value and we believe that end market demand will continue to be stronger that GAAP sellin revenue in the June quarter, and the channel and customer inventory will continue to decrease. We expect net sales for our products to be about flat sequentially plus or minus five percent in the June 2019 quarter.\\\" https:www.microchip.cominvestorPressreleaseMCHP20Announces20Financial20Results20for20Q420and20FY19.050719.pdf Broadcom Corporation Broadcom Limited NASDAQ:AVGO is a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of digital and analog semiconductor connectivity solutions.

NONGAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES To supplement its condensed consolidated unaudited financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Cypress uses the nonGAAP financial measures listed below, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as described in more detail below. NonGAAP gross profit NonGAAP gross margin NonGAAP cost of revenues NonGAAP interest and other expense, net NonGAAP research and development expenses NonGAAP selling, general and administrative expenses Adjusted EBITDA NonGAAP income tax provision benefit NonGAAP pretax profit NonGAAP pretax profit margin NonGAAP operating income NonGAAP operating margin NonGAAP net income NonGAAP diluted earnings per share and Free cash flow. Management believes that these nonGAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of the Companys operations which, when viewed in conjunction with Cypress GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting the Companys business and operations. The Company presents nonGAAP financial measures because management uses these measures to analyze and assess the Companys financial results and to manage the business. There are limitations in using nonGAAP financial measures, including those discussed below. Moreover, the Companys nonGAAP measures may be calculated differently than the nonGAAP financial measures used by other companies. The presentation of nonGAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The nonGAAP financial measures supplement and should be viewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. As presented in the NonGAAP Reconciliation Tables in this press release, each of the nonGAAP financial measures other than free cash flow excludes one or more of the following items: Acquisitionrelated charges: Acquisitionrelated charges are not factored into managements evaluation of Cypress longterm performance after the completion of acquisitions. However, a limitation of nonGAAP measures that exclude acquisitionrelated charges is that these charges may represent payments that reduce the cash available to the Company for other purposes. Acquisitionrelated expenses primarily include: Amortization of purchased intangibles, including purchased technology, patents, customer relationships, trademarks, backlog and noncompete agreements Amortization of stepup in value of inventory recorded as part of purchase price accounting and Onetime charges associated with the completion of an acquisition including items such as contract termination costs, severance and other acquisitionrelated restructuring costs costs incurred in connection with integration activities and legal and accounting costs. Stockbased compensation expense: Stockbased compensation expense relates primarily to employee stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock units and the employee stock purchase plan. Stockbased compensation expense is a noncash expense that is affected by changes in market factors including the price of Cypress common shares, which are not within the control of management. In addition, the valuation of stockbased compensation is subjective, and the expense recognized by Cypress may be significantly different than the expense recognized by other companies for similar equity awards, which makes it difficult to assess Cypress results compared to its competitors. Accordingly, management excludes this item from its internal operating forecasts and models. However, a limitation of nonGAAP measures that exclude stockbased compensation expense is that they do not reflect the full costs of compensating employees. Other adjustments: Other items are excluded from nonGAAP financial measures because management does not consider them to be related to the core operating activities and ongoing operating performance of Cypress. Excluding these items, which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter, allows management to better compare Cypress periodoverperiod performance. However, limitations of nonGAAP measures that exclude these items include that these adjustments are often subjective and such nonGAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled nonGAAP financial measures used by other companies. Other adjustments primarily include: Costs incurred in connection with the proposed merger, Impairments of equitymethod investments, Changes in value of deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities, Investmentrelated gains or losses, including equity method investments, Restructuring and related costs, Loss on extinguishment of debt, Amortization of debt issuance costs, discounts and imputed interest related to the equity component of convertible debt, Asset impairments, Tax effects of nonGAAP adjustments, Income tax adjustment related to the use of the net operating loss, noncash impact of not asserting indefinite reinvestment on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, deferred tax expense not affecting taxes payable i.e. release of valuation allowance, and noncash expense benefit related to uncertain tax positions, Certain other expenses and benefits, and Diluted weighted average shares nonGAAP adjustment for purposes of calculating nonGAAP diluted earnings per share, the GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding is adjusted to include the impact of nonGAAP adjustments on the number of diluted shares underlying stockbased compensation awards and the impact of the capped call transactions related to the convertible notes. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting net income loss attributable to Cypress to exclude without duplication: interest expense, income tax provision, depreciation, amortization, equity in net loss of equity method investees, and the nonGAAP adjustments described above acquisition related charges, stockbased compensation expense, and other adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information because the exclusion of certain gains, losses, and expenses facilitates comparisons of Cypress operating performance on a period to period basis. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to invest in the growth of the business. In addition, adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to net income attributable to Cypress, operating income, or diluted earnings per share, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by used in operating activities, less acquisition of property, plant and equipment, net i.e., acquisition of property, plant and equipment less proceeds received from disposition of property, plant and equipment. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by business operations, after deducting our net payments for acquisitions and dispositions of property and equipment, which cash can then be used for strategic opportunities or other business purposes including, among others, investing in the Companys business, repurchasing stock, making strategic acquisitions, repayment of debt, and strengthening the balance sheet. A limitation of free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Management compensates for this limitation by also relying on the net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as presented in the Companys condensed consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with GAAP which incorporates all cash movements during the period.

Growth in our commercial markets was mixed during the first quarter as it was affected by wellknown macro factors, including the recent overall slowing in industrial demand. However, we remain optimistic about the longterm growth prospects for all of our commercial end markets. Our Aerospace and Defense business delivered a very strong quarter, in part due to the successful integration of recent acquisitions. We have also put in place the measures to operate the Finisar WSS business separately as required by regulators due to the strong market position of both companies. We are ready to capitalize on new opportunities from the expected rapid growth in our key end markets. https:www.iivi.comnewsiiviincorporatedreportsfiscal2020firstquarterresults Infineon Technologies AG Infineon Technologies AG is a world leader in semiconductor solutions that make life easier, safer and greener.

Business Outlook Intels guidance for the fourthquarter and fullyear 2019 includes both GAAP and nonGAAP estimates. Reconciliations between these GAAP and nonGAAP financial measures are included below. Intels Business Outlook does not include the potential impact of any business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and other significant transactions that may be completed after October 24, 2019, except for the planned divestiture of the majority of our smartphone modem business and the pending sale of Intels interest in the IM Flash Technologies, LLC joint venture, which are both expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019. Actual results may differ materially from Intels Business Outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors described under ForwardLooking Statements below. ForwardLooking Statements Intels Business Outlook and other statements in this release that refer to future plans and expectations are forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Words such as \\\"anticipates,\\\" \\\"expects,\\\" \\\"intends,\\\" \\\"goals,\\\" \\\"plans,\\\" \\\"believes,\\\" \\\"seeks,\\\" \\\"estimates,\\\" \\\"continues,\\\" \\\"may,\\\" \\\"will,\\\" \\\"would,\\\" \\\"should,\\\" \\\"could,\\\" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements. Statements that refer to or are based on estimates, forecasts, projections, uncertain events or assumptions, including statements relating to total addressable market TAM or market opportunity, future products and the expected availability and benefits of such products, and anticipated trends in our businesses or the markets relevant to them, also identify forwardlooking statements. All forwardlooking statements included in this release are based on managements expectations as of the date of this release and, except as required by law, Intel disclaims any obligation to update these forwardlooking statements to reflect future events or circumstances. Forwardlooking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Intel presently considers the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the companys expectations. Demand for Intels products is highly variable and could differ from expectations due to factors including changes in business and economic conditions customer confidence or income levels, and the levels of customer capital spending the introduction, availability and market acceptance of Intels products, products used together with Intel products, and competitors products competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors supply constraints and other disruptions affecting customers changes in customer order patterns including order cancellations changes in customer needs and emerging technology trends and changes in the level of inventory at customers. Intels results could vary significantly from expectations based on capacity utilization variations in inventory valuation, including variations related to the timing of qualifying products for sale changes in revenue levels segment product mix the timing and execution of the manufacturing ramp and associated costs excess or obsolete inventory changes in unit costs defects or disruptions in the supply of materials or resources and product manufacturing qualityyields. Variations in results may also be caused by the timing of Intel product introductions and related expenses, including marketing programs, and Intels ability to respond quickly to technological developments and to introduce new products or incorporate new features into existing products, as well as decisions to exit product lines or businesses, which may result in restructuring and asset impairment charges. Intels results could be affected by adverse economic, social, political and physicalinfrastructure conditions in countries where Intel, its customers or its suppliers operate, including recession or slowing growth, military conflict and other security risks, natural disasters, infrastructure disruptions, health concerns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, sanctions and tariffs, and continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, including the United Kingdoms vote to withdraw from the European Union. Results may also be affected by the formal or informal imposition by countries of new or revised export andor import and doingbusiness regulations, which could be changed without prior notice. Intel operates in highly competitive industries and its operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term. In addition, in connection with our strategic transformation to a datacentric company, we have entered new areas and introduced adjacent products, where we face new sources of competition and uncertain market demand or acceptance of our products, and these new areas and products may not grow as projected. The amount, timing and execution of Intels stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on Intels priorities for the use of cash for other purposessuch as investing in our business, including operational and capital spending, acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend paymentsand because of changes in cash flows, tax laws, or the market price of our common stock. Intels expected tax rate is based on current tax law, including current interpretations of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 TCJA, and current expected income and may be affected by evolving interpretations of TCJA changes in the volume and mix of profits earned across jurisdictions with varying tax rates changes in the estimates of credits, benefits and deductions the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, including payment of interest and penalties and the ability to realize deferred tax assets. Intels results could be affected by gains or losses from equity securities and interest and other, which could vary depending on gains or losses on the change in fair value, sale, exchange, or impairments of equity and debt investments, interest rates, cash balances, and changes in fair value of derivative instruments. Product defects or errata deviations from published specifications may adversely impact our expenses, revenues and reputation. We or third parties regularly identify security vulnerabilities with respect to our processors and other products as well as the operating systems and workloads running on them. Security vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material, including incurring significant costs related to developing and deploying updates and mitigations, writing down inventory value, a reduction in the competitiveness of our products, defending against product claims and litigation, responding to regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, addressing customer satisfaction considerations, or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties. Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services. A detailed description of these risks is set forth in the \\\"Risk Factors\\\" section of our most recent reports on Forms 10K and 10Q. Intels results could be affected by litigation or regulatory matters involving intellectual property, stockholder, consumer, antitrust, commercial, disclosure and other issues. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting Intel from manufacturing or selling one or more products, precluding particular business practices, impacting Intels ability to design its products, or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of intellectual property. Intels results may be affected by the timing of closing of acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions. In addition, these transactions could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, disrupt our ongoing business, and adversely impact our results of operations. We also may not realize the expected benefits of portfolio decisions due to numerous risks, including unfavorable prices and terms changes in market conditions limitations due to regulatory or governmental approvals, contractual terms, or other conditions and potential continued financial obligations associated with such transactions. Risks associated with the planned divestiture of the majority of Intels smartphone modem business are described in the ForwardLooking Statements section of Intels press release titled Apple to Acquire Majority of Intels Smartphone Modem Business, dated July 25, 2019. Detailed information regarding these and other factors that could affect Intels business and results is included in Intels SEC filings, including the companys most recent reports on Forms 10K and 10Q, particularly the \\\"Risk Factors\\\" sections of those reports.

NXP has based the guidance included in this release on judgments and estimates that management believes are reasonable given its assessment of historical trends and other information reasonably available as of the date of this release. Please note, the guidance included in this release consists of predictions only, and is subject to a wide range of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond NXPs control. The guidance included in this release should not be regarded as representations by NXP that the estimated results will be achieved.

NonGAAP Financial Measures In managing NXPs business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using nonGAAP financial measures. In measuring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these nonGAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing our gross margin and operating margin and when assessing appropriate levels of research and development efforts. In addition, management relies upon these nonGAAP financial measures when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. We believe that these nonGAAP financial measures, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Companys results of operations and the factors and trends affecting NXPs business. We believe that they enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain noncash expenses and sharebased compensation expense, which may obscure trends in NXPs underlying performance. This information also enables investors to compare financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance,and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management. These nonGAAP financial measures are provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of these and other similar items in NXPs nonGAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are nonrecurring, infrequent, or unusual. Reconciliations of these nonGAAP measures to the most comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial statements portion of this release in a schedule entitled Financial Reconciliation of GAAP to nonGAAP Results unaudited. Please refer to the NXP Historic Financial Model file found on the Financial Information page of the Investor Relations section of our website at https:investors.nxp.com for additional information related to our rationale for using these nonGAAP financial measures, as well as the impact of these measures on the presentation of NXPs operations. In addition to providing financial information on a basis consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP, NXP also provides the following selected financial measures on a nonGAAP basis: i Gross profit, ii Gross margin, iii Research and development, iv Selling, general and administrative, v Amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets, vi Other income, vii Operating income loss, viii Operating margin, ix Financial Income expense, x adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA and trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, and xi free cash flow and free cash flow as a percent of Revenue. The nonGAAP information excludes the amortization of acquisition related intangible assets, the purchase accounting effect on inventory and property, plant and equipment, merger related costs including integration costs, certain items related to divestitures, sharebased compensation expense, restructuring and asset impairment charges, noncash interest expense on convertible notes, extinguishment of debt, and foreign exchange gains and losses.

We believe that with our investments in automotive, industrial, and cloudpower markets, and into our operations, we are well positioned to deliver strong revenue and margin performance.\\\" FOURTH QUARTER 2019 OUTLOOK Based on product booking trends, backlog levels, and estimated turns levels, the Company anticipates 2019 fourth quarter revenue to be approximately 1,350 to 1,400 million. GAAP gross margin for fourth quarter of 2019 is expected to be between 35.7 percent and 36.7 percent. NonGAAP gross margin for fourth quarter of 2019 is expected to be between 35.7 percent and 36.7 percent. The 2019 fourth quarter outlook also includes anticipated stockbased compensation expense of approximately 17 million to 19 million. Net cash paid for income taxes is expected to be 14 million to 18 million. The following table outlines ON Semiconductors projected fourth quarter of 2019 GAAP and nonGAAP outlook. FINANCIALS Convertible Notes, Noncash Interest Expense is calculated pursuant to FASBs Accounting Standards Codification Topic 470: Debt. Diluted share count can vary as a result of, among other things, the actual exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the incremental dilutive shares from the Companys convertible senior subordinated notes, and the repurchase or the issuance of stock or convertible notes or the sale of treasury shares. In periods in which the quarterly average stock price per share exceeds 18.50, the nonGAAP diluted share count and nonGAAP net income per share include the impact of the Companys hedge transactions issued concurrently with our 1.00 convertible notes. As such, at an average stock price per share between 18.50 and 25.96, the hedging activity offsets the potentially dilutive effect of the 1.00 convertible notes. In periods when the quarterly average stock price per share exceeds 20.72, the nonGAAP diluted share count and nonGAAP net income per share include the antidilutive impact of the Companys hedge transactions issued concurrently with the 1.625 convertible notes. At an average stock price per share between 20.72 and 30.70, the hedging activity offsets the potentially dilutive effect of the 1.625 convertible notes. Both GAAP and nonGAAP diluted share counts are based on the Companys stock price as of September 27, 2019. Special items may include: amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles expensing of appraised inventory fair market value stepup purchased inprocess research and development expenses restructuring, asset impairments and other, net goodwill impairment charges gains and losses on debt prepayment noncash interest expense actuarial gains losses on pension plans and other pension benefits and certain other special items, as necessary. These special items are out of our control and could change significantly from period to period. As a result, we are not able to reasonably estimate and separately present the individual impact or probable significance of these special items, and we are similarly unable to provide a reconciliation of the nonGAAP measures. The reconciliation that is unavailable would include a forwardlooking income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows in accordance with GAAP. For this reason, we use a projected range of the aggregate amount of special items in order to calculate our projected nonGAAP operating expense outlook. We believe these nonGAAP measures provide important supplemental information to investors. We use these measures, together with GAAP measures, for internal managerial purposes and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons. However, we do not, and you should not, rely on nonGAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. We believe that nonGAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when taken together with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures that we also provide in our releases, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Because nonGAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nonGAAP financial measures, even if they have similar names. https:www.onsemi.comPowerSolutionsnewsItem.do?article4423 Qualcomm Incorporated Qualcomms technologies powered the smartphone revolution and connected billions of people.

Reports Third Quarter 2019 Results October 24, 2019 SK hynix Inc. or the Company, www.skhynix.comtoday announced financial results for its third quarter 2019 ended on September 30, 2019. The consolidated third quarter revenue was 6.84 trillion won while the operating profit amounted to 473 billion won and the net income 495 billion won. Operating margin and net margin for the quarter was 7. The revenue in the third quarter increased by 6 quarteroverquarter QoQ as demand began to pick up. However, the operating profit fell by 26 QoQas DRAM unit cost reduction was not enough to offset the price drop. DRAM bit shipments increased by 23 QoQ as the Company actively responded to the new products in the mobile market and purchases from some data centercustomers also increased. DRAM prices remained weak during the quarter, leading to a 16 drop in the average selling price, with the decline smaller than the previous quarter. Although SK hynix actively responded to the solution market, such as highdensity mobile products and SSDs, where demand continues to recover, NANDFlash bit shipments decreased by 1 QoQ because the company cut back raw NAND sales that was temporarily increased in the last quarter. It also resulted in a 4 increase in the average selling price as raw NAND is relatively cheap. SK hynix plans to develop production and investment strategy to meet growing customer demands as well as effectively deal with demand fluctuations dueto external uncertainties. The Company is converting part of the DRAM production lines of its M10 FAB in Icheon, Korea, to CMOS image sensor CIS mass production lines, whilereducing 2D NAND Flash wafer capacity. As a result, both DRAM and NAND Flash capacity will decrease next year compared to this year, and the amount of investment is expected to shrink considerably next year as well. SK hynix will continue to focus on technology migration and expand sales of highdensity, highvalueadded products in order to achieve greater growthwhen the market improves. The Company intends to increase the proportion of 1Ynm DRAM in the product portfolio to early 10 by the end of this year and prepare for mass productionof the recently developed 1Znm DRAM products. In addition, the Company plans to actively respond to the LPDDR5 and HBM2E markets, both of which are expected to be increasingly adopted by customers next year. For NAND Flash, SK hynix will increase the proportion of 96layer 4D NAND products to more than mid10 by the end of this year, while preparing formass production and sales of 128layer 4D NAND Flash. As the Company will focus on the highend smartphone and SSD markets, SSD is expected to account for around 30 of the Companys NAND Flash sales in the fourth quarter. SK hynix will minimize business volatility based on this experience of a downturn, while making efforts to achieve sustainable growth. About SK hynix Inc.

Within the EPS segment, the operating income loss of Mobile Communications for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019 was 29,814 million yen and 635 million yen, respectively. In addition, the operating income loss of the six months ended September 30, 2018 and 2019 was 40,572 million yen and 1,674 million yen, respectively Significant Changes in Shareholders Equity Based on the resolution of the Board of Directors at the meeting held on May 16, 2019, Sony Corporationrepurchased 21,409,600 shares of its common stock for 124,999 million yen during the six months ended September 30, 2019. The balance of treasury stock was 229,782 million yen, at cost, as of September 30, 2019 primarily due to the abovementioned repurchase of common stock. Accounting Policies and Other Information Recently adopted accounting pronouncements Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 201602, which amends current leasing guidance. The ASU requires substantially all leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. Sony has applied this ASU as of April 1, 2019, on a modified retrospective basis with no restatement of comparative periods. Sony has applied the package of practical expedients for leases that expired or existed prior to the adoption date. As a result, Sony did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, or whether initial direct costs for any existing leases qualify for capitalization. In addition, Sony has applied the shortterm lease exception. As a result of the adoption of this ASU, Sony recognized 316,923 million yen of operating lease rightofuse assets and 341,251 million yen of lease liabilities for operating leases on the consolidated balance sheets at April 1, 2019. This impact is mainly due to operating leases of real estate. The difference of 24,328 million yen between rightofuse assets and lease liabilities represents deferred rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which was offset against the opening balance of operating lease rightofuse assets. Finance lease rightofuse assets which are included in property, plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, are now presented as finance lease rightofuse assets from April 1, 2019 onward. Targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 201712, which made targeted improvements to the accounting for hedging activities. The amendments in this update simplify certain aspects of hedge accounting for both nonfinancial and financial risks and better align the recognition and measurement of hedge results with an entitys risk management activities. This ASU also amends certain presentation and disclosure requirements for hedging activities and changes how an entity assesses hedge effectiveness. This ASU was effective for Sony as of April 1, 2019. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on Sonys results of operations and financial position. Number of Consolidated Subsidiaries and Affiliated Companies As of September 30, 2019, Sony had 1,546 consolidated subsidiaries including variable interest entities and 132 affiliated companies accounted for under the equity method. Segmentation Sony realigned its business segments from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 to reflect modifications to the organizational structure of certain segments and a change in the Senior Executives in charge of certain segments as of April 1, 2019. In connection with this decision, the former Home Entertainment Sound, Imaging Products Solutions and Mobile Communications segments have been realigned as the Electronics Products Solutions EPS segment. In connection with this realignment, the sales and operating revenue and operating income loss of each segment for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. In addition, the former Semiconductors segment has been renamed the Imaging Sensing Solutions ISS segment effective from the first quarter of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. The GNS segment includes network services businesses, the manufacture and sales of home gaming products and production and sales of software. The Music segment includes the Recorded Music, Music Publishing and Visual Media and Platform businesses. The Pictures segment includes the Motion Pictures, Television Productions and Media Networks businesses. The EPS segment includes the Televisions business, the Audio and Video business, the Still and Video Cameras business, the smartphone business and Internetrelated service business. The ISS segment includes the image sensors business. The Financial Services segment primarily represents individual life insurance and nonlife insurance businesses in the Japanese market and a bank business in Japan. All Other consists of various operating activities, including the disc manufacturing and recording media businesses. Sonys products and services are generally unique to a single operating segment. Accounting Methods Used Specifically for Interim Consolidated Financial Statements Income Taxes Sony estimates the annual effective tax rate ETR derived from a projected annual net income before taxes and calculates the interim period income tax provision based on the yeartodate income tax provision computed by applying the ETR to the yeartodate net income before taxes at the end of each interim period. The income tax provision based on the ETR reflects anticipated income tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards however, it excludes the income tax provision related to significant unusual or infrequent transactions. Such income tax provision is separately reported from the provision based on the ETR in the interim period in which it occurs. Reclassifications Certain reclassifications of the financial statements and accompanying footnotes for the three and six months ended September 30, 2018 have been made to conform to the presentation for the three and six months ended September 30, 2019. Outlook for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2020 Consolidated sales and operating revenue sales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020 are expected to be lower than the July forecast due to lowerthanexpected sales in the Game Network Services GNS, Electronics Products Solutions EPS and Pictures segments, partially offset by higherthanexpected sales in the Imaging Sensing Solutions ISS and Music segments. Consolidated operating income is expected to be higher than the July forecast due to an expected increase in operating income primarily in the ISS segment and an expected decrease in operating loss in All Other, Corporate and elimination, partially offset by expected decreases in operating income in the GNS and EPS segments. Restructuring charges for the Sony Group are expected to be approximately 24.0 billion yen, which remains unchanged from the July forecast, compared to 33.1 billion yen in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019. Restructuring charges are recorded as an operating expense and are included in the forecast for operating income. Income before income taxes is expected to be 800 billion yen, which is higher than the July forecast. This expected increase is primarily due to the abovementioned expected increase in operating income. Net income attributable to Sony Corporations stockholders is expected to be higher than the July forecast due to the abovementioned expected increase in income before income taxes, as well as lowerthanexpected effective tax rates. Game Network Services GNS Sales are expected to be lower than the July forecast primarily due to lowerthanexpected software sales including the impact of a change in the launch date of a firstparty title, lowerthanexpected PlayStation4 hardware unit sales and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be significantly lower than the July forecast primarily due to the impact of the abovementioned expected decrease in software sales and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by expected cost reductions and an increase in sales for PlayStationPlus. Music Sales are expected to be higher than the July forecast primarily due to an expected increase in streaming revenues in Recorded Music and Music Publishing. Operating income is expected to be higher than the July forecast primarily due to the impact of the abovementioned expected increase in sales. Pictures Sales are expected to be lower than the July forecast primarily due to a delay in the timing of theatrical releases in Motion Pictures, as well as lower advertising and subscription revenues in Media Networks primarily due to the impact of the channel portfolio review that began in the previous fiscal year. Operating income is expected to be higher than the July forecast primarily due to an expected decrease in marketing costs resulting from the abovementioned release date changes in Motion Pictures and higher operating results in India as well as the benefit of the abovementioned portfolio review in Media Networks. Electronics Products Solutions EPS Sales are expected to be lower than the July forecast primarily due to lowerthanexpected unit sales of televisions and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be lower than the July forecast primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the impact of the abovementioned expected decrease in sales, partially offset by expected further reductions in operating costs. Imaging Sensing Solutions ISS Sales are expected to be higher than the July forecast due to higherthanexpected sales of image sensors for mobile products, resulting from an improvement in product mix and higherthanexpected unit sales. Operating income is expected to be significantly higher than the July forecast primarily due to the impact of the abovementioned expected increase in sales. The forecasts for financial services revenue and operating income for the Financial Services segment remain unchanged from the July forecast. The effects of future gains and losses on investments held by the Financial Services segment due to market fluctuations have not been incorporated within the above forecast as it is difficult for Sony to predict market trends in the future. Accordingly, future market fluctuations could further impact the current forecast. The above forecast is based on managements current expectations and is subject to uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those included in this forecast due to a variety of factors.

Note: For convenience only, all dollar figures used in reporting the first quarter of FY2019 are calculated at 108 yen to the dollar. Others Changes in significant subsidiaries during the period changes in Specified Subsidiaries Tokutei Kogaisha involving changes in the scope of consolidation: None. Use of simplified accounting procedures, and particular accounting procedures in preparation of quarterly consolidated financial statements: Income taxes Interim income tax expense benefit is computed by multiplying income loss before income taxes and noncontrolling interests for the threemonths period ending June 30, 2019 by a reasonably estimated annual effective tax rate after applying the effect of deferred taxes for FY2019, ending March 31, 2020. If a reliable estimate cannot be made as in the circumstances that the annual estimated ordinary pretax incomeloss approximates breakeven or is forecasted negative, the Company utilizes the actual yeartodate effective tax rate. Change in accounting policies: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 201602 Leases. ASU No. 201602 requires lessees to recognize rightofuse assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, with some exceptions, related to their lease agreements that are classified as operating leases. The Group adopted ASU No. 201602 effective from the first quarter, beginning April 1, 2019, and recognized the cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. In applying ASU No. 201602, for contracts that have expired or still effective as of the initial application date, the Group adopted the series of practical expedients that allows an entity to not reassess whether a lease contract contains a lease, the existing lease classification and the capitalization of any initial direct costs. The Group also elected to apply the shortterm lease exemption. As a result, rightofuse assets and lease liabilities recognized at April 1, 2019 were 174,005 million and 176,825 million, respectively. Rightofuse assets are included in noncurrent assets in the quarterly consolidated balance sheets, while lease liabilities are included in current and noncurrent liabilities. The Group assessed the impact on the opening balance of retained earnings, other items within profit or loss, and the consolidated statement of cash flows as immaterial. http:www.toshiba.co.jpaboutirenfinanceerer2019q1ter2019q1e.pdf United Microelectronics Corporation UMC NYSE: UMC, TWSE: 2303 is a leading global semiconductor foundry that provides advanced IC production for applications spanning every major sector of the electronics industry.

Commenting on results for the third quarter 2019, Dr. Gerald Paul, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, Vishays financial performance has been negatively impacted by low demand, especially from distribution. However, during the third quarter inventories of Vishays products at distribution started to come down noticeably. Still high levels of inventories in the global supply chain should impact our business for another two quarters. We are managing the slowdown by adapting costs as we have done in the past. On the other hand, our increased machine capacities will enable Vishay to participate in the next upturn to the full extent. Commenting on the outlook Dr. Paul stated, For the fourth quarter we expect a continuation of the inventory reduction in the supply chain and guide for revenues in a range of 580 to 620 million and gross margins of 23 to 24.

Additional second quarter of fiscal year 2020 comparisons are provided in the charts below. Q2 2020 Financial Highlights In millions, except EPS \\\"I am pleased to report that we were able to exceed the midpoint of our revenue guidance for the fiscal second quarter amidst a challenging business environment driven by global trade disputes. Overall, the first half of our current fiscal year remained strong despite the impact of continued business restrictions related to Huawei which was offset by higher than expected 5G product demand from other global communications OEMs and stronger than expected growth in our data center business,\\\" said Victor Peng, president and chief executive officer. \\\"However, we are seeing a combination of headwinds in the second half related to continuing business restrictions, weaker demand for communications products and macrorelated weakness offsetting strong overall growth in data center and improvement across our core vertical markets. For fiscal 2020, we believe that third quarter will be our low point and we expect to see a return to sequential revenue growth in our fourth quarter. Despite the weaker third quarter, we expect fiscal year 2020 revenues to grow approximately six percent compared to fiscal year 2019, which represents the midpoint of our guidance.\\\" Products are classified as follows: Advanced Products: Alveo, UltraScale, UltraScale and 7series products. Core Products: Virtex6, Spartan6, Virtex5, CoolRunnerII, Virtex4, VirtexII, Spartan3, Spartan2, XC9500 products, configuration solutions, software supportservices. Key Statistics: Dollars in Millions Product and Financial Highlights Fiscal Second Quarter 2020 The Advanced Products category increased 29 year over year and constituted approximately 74 of total revenues in the second quarter. Our 16 nanometer nm node continued its accelerated ramp, with revenues increasing over 3 times yearoveryear, primarily driven by customers in 5G and Data Center. Xilinx announced the expansion of its 16nm Virtex UltraScale family to include the worlds largest FPGA the Virtex UltraScale VU19P. With 35 billion transistors, the VU19P provides the highest logic density and IO count on a single device ever built, enabling emulation and prototyping of tomorrows most advanced ASIC and SoC technologies, as well as test, measurement, compute, networking, aerospace and defenserelated applications. Zynqbased revenues grew 61 year over year, with continuing business momentum from a broad base of end markets including Communications, Automotive and Industrial. The Zynq SoC platform, which includes Zynq at 28nm and both MPSoC and RFSoC at 16nm, now represents 26 of total revenues, indicating significant progress in Xilinxs transformation into a platform company. Xilinx announced the expansion of its Alveo accelerator card portfolio with the launch of the Alveo U50. The Alveo U50 is the industrys first low profile, halfheight, halflength accelerator card with PCIe Gen 4 support and delivers between 1020x improvements in throughput, latency and power efficiency. At the third annual Xilinx Developer Forum held in San Jose, California, Xilinx announced Vitis, a unified software platform that enables a broad new range of developers including software engineers and AI scientists to take advantage of the power of hardware adaptability. The Vitis unified software platform automatically tailors the Xilinx hardware architecture to the software or algorithmic code without the need for hardware expertise. Rather than imposing a proprietary development environment, the Vitis platform plugs into common software developer tools and utilizes a rich set of optimized open source libraries, enabling developers to focus on their algorithms. Xilinx repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of 103.60 per share and paid dividends of 93 million during the quarter. Business Outlook Fiscal Third Quarter 2020 Fiscal Year 2020 The following guidance is based on current expectations and estimates, and as indicated, is presented on a GAAP and nonGAAP basis. This guidance is forwardlooking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed and referred to at the end of this release. Xilinxs fiscal third quarter and fiscal year 2020 guidance takes into account the impact from the U.S. governments announced export restriction to one of our customers in China and assumes no revenues from that customer. Fiscal Third Quarter 2020 Fiscal Year 2020 NonGAAP Financial Information Fiscal second quarter 2020 results and business outlook for the December quarter and fiscal year 2020 include financial measures which are not determined in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles GAAP, as indicated. NonGAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of nonGAAP financial measures has been reconciled, in each case, to the most directlycomparable GAAP measure, as indicated in the accompanying tables. The Companys calculation of such nonGAAP measures may not be comparable to similarlytitled measures used by other companies. Management uses the nonGAAP financial measures disclosed herein to evaluate the Companys financial results from continuing operations excluding the impact of acquisitions and compare to operating performance in past periods. Similarly, Management believes presentation of these nonGAAP measures is useful to investors because it enables investors and analysts to evaluate operating expenses of the Companys core business, excluding the impact of noncore business expenses such as acquisitionrelated amortization and nonrecurring items. MA related expenses: These expenses mainly consist of legal and consulting fees associated with acquisition activities. We believe these costs do not reflect the Companys current operating performance. Consequently, the nonGAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of the Companys current operating performance and comparisons to its past operating performance. Amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles: Amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology acquired in connection with business combinations. The nonGAAP adjustments exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of the Companys current operating performance and comparisons to its past operating performance. Inventory valuation adjustment: Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of inventory reflects the acquired companys cost of manufacturing plus a portion of the expected profit margin. The nonGAAP adjustment to our cost of sales excludes the expected profit margin component that is recorded under business combination accounting principles associated with our acquisitions. We believe the adjustments are useful to investors as an additional means to reflect cost of sales and gross margin trends of our business. Gain on investment related to acquisition: The Company excludes the accounting gain resulting from revaluation of its prior minority investment in DeePhi Tech. The Company believes excluding this gain will facilitate a comparable evaluation of its current operating performance to its past operating performance. Income taxes: The Company excludes the income tax effects of nonGAAP adjustments reflected in Operating Expenses and Other Income, as detailed above. It also excludes U.S. tax reform related items. The Company believes excluding U.S. tax reform related items will facilitate a comparable evaluation of its current performance to its past performance. The third quarter of fiscal 2020 and fiscal year 2020 outlook does not reflect other tax related items which we are not able to predict without unreasonable efforts due to their inherent uncertainty.

With Compute CloudCustomer, customers can develop, deploy, secure, and manage workloads using the same software stack as OCI in deployments as small as a single rack. Oracle Compute CloudCustomer enables organizations to run applications and middleware on OCI compute, storage, and networking services with flexible virtual machine VM shapes in their data centers. When combined with Oracle Exadata CloudCustomer, it is the ideal platform for workloads that are tightly integrated with Oracle databases. Organizations can use the same OCI services in their data centers and Oracle Cloud Regions, while developers and IT managers can use the same APIs and management tools to deliver a consistent user experience everywhere. Organizations can also consolidate existing workloads and deploy new cloudnative applications on a fully managed cloud platform in their data centers, enabling them to capitalize on OCIs costeffective consumption model to streamline operations and reduce costs. \\\"Users want a consistent experience regardless of where services are running, and that is why we continue to invest in our distributed cloud strategy with the launch of Compute CloudCustomer,\\\" said Edward Screven, chief corporate architect, Oracle. \\\"Oracle provides a choice of OCI public cloud regions, Dedicated Region, and CloudCustomer platforms that customers can combine to create a globally distributed cloud solution. This choice makes it easy for customers to achieve their strategic cloud business objectives while enabling them to address data residency requirements and to access highperformance connections to existing data center and latencysensitive applications.\\\" Architected for high performance and high availability, Compute CloudCustomer can be easily expanded to meet the needs of small and large organizations, each with a different distributed cloud deployment scenario. Starting with 552 processor cores and 150 TB of usable storage block, file, andor object, Compute CloudCustomer can scale compute and storage independently to more than 6,000 processor cores and 3.4 PB of storage capacity. Unlike onpremises offerings from other public cloud providers that are assembled from thirdparty components or have very limited capabilities, Oracle Compute CloudCustomer is a completely integrated cloud platformbuilt, installed, owned, and managed by Oracle. It is entirely compatible with the OCI public cloud regions and OCI Dedicated Region and delivers the same core OCI cloud services, at the same low pricing. These capabilities reduce the burden of maintenance and upgrades for customers while enabling customers to develop and run cloud native applications anywhere. \\\"For organizations looking to deploy cloud services onpremises, the message is go big or go home,\\\" said Ron Westfall, research director, The Futurum Group. \\\"So many onpremises cloud services are either warmedover hardware boxes gift wrapped with financial engineering tools or I see them offering onetenth the capabilities of their public cloud counterparts.

Today, Adobe Nasdaq:ADBE announced the latest online inflation data from the Adobe Digital Price Index DPI, powered by Adobe Analytics. Online prices in July 2023 fell 1.6 yearoveryear YoY, marking the eleventh consecutive month of YoY price decreases, with the majority of categories 11 of 18 tracked by Adobe seeing falling prices on an annual basis. On a monthovermonth MoM basis, online prices fell 0.9 in July. Julys YoY price decline was driven by notable drops in categories such as appliances, which fell 8 YoY down 0.3 MoM, as well as furniturebedding which fell 3.5 YoY down 0.7 MoM. Steeper YoY declines were observed in electronics, which fell 11.7 YoY down 0.7 MoM as well as computers, which fell 15.4 YoY down 1.5 MoM. Although the grocery category has experienced persistent inflation, YoY price increases have now slowed for 10 consecutive months. Grocery prices were up 6.3 YoY up 0.3 MoM, a smaller jump compared with June 2023s 7.6 YoY and May 2023s 8.2 YoY increases. Price increases have slowed for pet products as well Prices were up 6.3 YoY down 0.1 MoM, compared with an 8.1 YoY increase in June 2023, and an even more substantial 10.2 YoY increase in May 2023. Notable categories in the Adobe Digital Price Index for July Adobes Digital Price Index provides the most comprehensive view into how much consumers pay for goods online, complementing the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, which captures offline prices. Powered by Adobe Analytics, the DPI analyzes one trillion visits to retail sites and over 100 million SKUs across 18 product categories: electronics, apparel, appliances, books, toys, computers, groceries, furniturebedding, toolshome improvement, homegarden, pet products, jewelry, medical equipmentsupplies, sporting goods, personal care products, flowersrelated gifts, nonprescription drugs and office supplies. In July, 11 of the DPIs 18 categories saw YoY price decreases, with the flowersrelated gifts category falling the most at 31.6 YoY. Seven categories experienced YoY price increases, including personal care, pet products, grocery, nonprescription drugs, toolshome improvement, medical equipmentsupplies and apparel. On a MoM basis, 16 of the 18 categories in the DPI saw prices fall. Price increases were observed in only two categories including groceries and nonprescription drugs. Notable categories for July 2023 include: Groceries: Prices rose 6.3 YoY up 0.3 MoM but have slowed in the past 10 months, rising 7.6 YoY in June, 8.2 YoY in May, 9.3 YoY in April, 10.3 YoY in March, 11.4 YoY in February, 12.6 YoY in January, 13.5 YoY in December, 13.7 YoY in November and 14 YoY in October. In September, the rate of price growth peaked, rising 14.3 YoY. Consumers are increasingly buying more of their groceries online, and this category has generally moved in lock step with the Consumer Price Index. Pet Products: Prices were up 6.3 YoY down 0.1 MoM, a smaller increase than the month prior, when prices rose 8.1 YoY June 2023. In August 2022, prices for the category rose substantially and peaked at 12.7 YoY. This category has seen persistent inflation on a longterm basis, with YoY price increases observed in every month since May 2020. Appliances: Prices were down 8 YoY down 0.3 MoM after hitting a record low in June 2023, where prices fell 8.3 YoY. Appliance prices online have now fallen YoY for 10 consecutive months, after having risen for 29 consecutive months starting in May 2020, peaking at 7.1 YoY in December 2020. Electronics: Prices have continued to fall sharply in recent months, dropping 11.7 YoY down 0.7 MoM and 12.9 YoY in June 2023. Contrast this with a year ago, in July 2022, when prices were down 9.3 YoY. As a major discretionary category, electronics price movements have a significant impact on overall inflation online. Methodology Adobes DPI is modeled after the Consumer Price Index CPI, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and uses the Fisher Price Index to track online prices. The Fisher Price Index uses quantities of matched products purchased in the current period month and a previous period previous month to calculate the price changes by category. Adobes analysis is weighted by the real quantities of the products purchased in the two adjacent months. Powered by Adobe Analytics, Adobe uses a combination of Adobes AI and machine learning framework Adobe Sensei and manual effort to segment products into the categories defined by the CPI manual. The methodology was first developed alongside renowned economists Austan Goolsbee and Pete Klenow. Adobe Analytics is part of Adobe Experience Cloud, which over 85 of the top 100 internet retailers in the U.S. rely upon to deliver, measure and personalize shopping experiences online.

Joshi, Narendra B. Dahotre Abstract The industrial Internet of Things IIoT has grown to empower advantages of advanced manufacturing machinery and smarter control. The cloudbased technology of remote data collection, intelligent machine interconnectivity, and sensor monitoring provide the opportunity for a pattern modification across all manufacturing divisions including the latest and rapidly growing technology of additive manufacturing AM or 3D printing. AM is a type of direct manufacturing and revolutionary technology that enables complicated production and a formation which can shorten manufacturing processes and supply chain procedures. Data is a key factor in the age of big data, embedded IIoT solutions, and services in the new machinery and mechanism that bring an additional capability to integrate and manage data streams within the Internet of Things IoT cloudbased platform. Movement and merging conventional legacy manufacturing technology into the shared and modern machinery required for the stateoftheart manufacturing technology such as AM is complex and challenging, but it needs to be organized and fixed resourcefully, while it remains linked, flexible, and scalable. AM is an advanced manufacturing system and technology involving the new era of complex machinery and operating systems. AM has been identified as a special value to the industry which has many applications in the different industries such as aerospace, medical and healthcare, energy, and automotive. Hence, highperformance computation and processing will be very important in AM. This research takes an overview of the cloudbased model and concept of cloud computing CC, cloud manufacturing CM, IoT, and their relations and influences in the AM industry 4.0 era. This study contributes as a theoretical basis and as a comprehensive framework for AM integration. Furthermore, this paper presents CM applications and integration with AM and proposes an integrated AM cloud platform. https:link.springer.comarticle10.1007s0017002108436x The Industry NOVEMBER 2022 IT INDUSTRY OUTLOOK 2023 Heading into 2023, the signs of progress that appeared over the past year continue to blossom. The organizations that have made it through recent and ongoing turmoil are using their newfound resilience as a springboard into the future. The return to strategy predicted by CompTIAs IT Industry Outlook 2022 has become a reality for many organizations, and they are now focused on writing their next chapter. Those new chapters hold a tremendous amount of potential. Spurred by global events, companies may decide to focus more effort on improving the world around them. There are clearly big problems to solve what may be less clear is that many solutions already have good momentum. According to the 2022 Goalkeepers report from the Gates Foundation, the percentage of the global population living below the international poverty line has fallen by nearly 20 since 2015, and the rate of mortality for children under 5 has fallen by more than 50 since 1990. Organizations that choose to make an impact on social issues can help drive greater improvement. Closer to home, there is potential for individual company growth. The modern business world is far less constrained by geographic reach, financial backing or language barriers. Organizations have more opportunities than ever to diversify their workforce, reach new customers and develop new products. Whether it is expanding current offerings or pivoting to a new business model, companies can build on lessons learned to reach new heights. No matter which direction an organization may choose, technology will play a starring role in the story. Technology alone cannot solve all the worlds problems, but it can accelerate solutions for those with the right vision. The technology industry may face future headwinds around ethical concerns or regulatory maneuvering, but there is no doubt that those hoping to make a difference can use technology to unlock the potential they imagine. Industry Overview The importance of technology in our modern world means that the technology industry is a true force to be reckoned with. The sheer size of the industry makes it one of the dominant sectors in the global economy, and the rapid growth and rate of change within the industry make it a central player in developing business standards and regulations. The impact of technology goes far beyond the core tech industry, though. While there are myriad opportunities directly related to digital product development or service delivery, there are countless more opportunities opening up around the world as technology influences every business and every industry vertical. To start, consider economic output. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA within the U.S. Department of Commerce, overall GDP grew by 18 between Q1 of 2020 and Q1 of 2022. In contrast, the subindustry that most closely represents the core tech industry Data processing, internet publishing and other information services grew by 47. This growth rate trailed only two subindustries related to oil and petroleum many other subindustries grew at much slower rates or experienced contraction during this time. Although that growth alone is noteworthy, it pales in comparison to the extended impact of digital activity. As of Q1 2022, the same subindustry contributed to 1.7 of overall U.S. GDP. Looking across industries at three broad categories of digital economic activity infrastructure, ecommerce and priced digital services, the BEA estimates that the overall digital economy contributed to 10.2 of U.S. GDP in 2020. Roughly speaking, the extended digital activities taking place outside the core IT industry have five times more impact than direct tech industry activity. The exact numbers differ from country to country, especially in maturing economies vs. mature economies, but the basic premise holds: Technology has a massive direct and indirect impact on economic growth. A second area to consider is the workforce. According to CompTIAs State of the Tech Workforce report, technology was expected to account for 8.9 million jobs in the United States in 2022. This represents both those individuals working directly within the tech industry and those individuals in core tech occupations within other industries. With a labor force just over 158 million workers, direct tech occupations account for nearly 6 of the U.S. workforce. Once again, the impact of technology extends far beyond these numbers. Examining job postings from the labor analysis firm Lightcast, there were 4.2 million job postings for core technology occupations between September 2021 and August 2022. Over that same time period, there were 10.7 million job postings requesting skills in basic computer literacy and productivity tools such as Microsoft Office. Of the top ten occupations within the 10.7 million job postings, only computer user support specialist is a core tech occupation. Other occupational categories include managers, human resources specialists and registered nurses. Finally, the amount organizations are spending on IT demonstrates the rapidly changing nature of technology. Gartner estimates that 2023 global IT spending will reach 4.6 trillion in 2023, a jump of 5.1 over 2022 spending. The categories included in Gartners estimate are traditional IT components: Communications services, IT services, devices, software and data center systems. As expected, the service categories are the largest pieces, as most organizations have built a foundational layer of computing and are now crafting new solutions on top of that foundation. In addition to these traditional categories, emerging technology is driving additional spending. Data from IDC, which CompTIA has used in previous years, shows roughly the same level of spending in the traditional categories. IDC, though, adds a category of \\\"new technologies,\\\" which includes technology such as internet of things IoT, robotics and mixed reality. Spending on new technologies is expected to hit 1.36 trillion in 2023, adding nearly 30 to the expected spending on traditional items. One final note on spending projections: The current economic chaos, including inflation and relative strength of global currencies, is impacting forecasting models as much as it is driving uncertainty for businesses. Actual spending may fluctuate more in 2023 than in previous years. Given both the direct and indirect impacts of technology, it is no surprise to see positive sentiment toward the industry. Among technology firms in each of the six different geographic regions surveyed by CompTIA, the average rating for the future prospects of the overall technology industry skewed toward the higher end of the scale. Even with economic uncertainties and societal issues, the tech industry remains a robust choice for business growth and career advancement. For the remainder of this report, the focus is on U.S. data. Separate research briefs highlight data points from international regions. All in all, the impact of technology today goes far beyond the technology itself. Technology is deeply ingrained into business activity and daily life. There is no question that there are some negative elements, especially as technology applications reach massive scale and trigger unintended consequences. However, there is also no question that there are many positive outcomes, and a progressive approach to technology is a critical factor for sustained success. CAREERS IN TECHNOLOGY: BUILDING STRATEGIC SKILLS Caught between the recent disruption of the pandemic and the potential upheaval of a recession, technical professionals share many concerns with the rest of the workforce. However, the turmoil is not dampening spirits for IT pros. As with last year, nearly 80 of IT professionals in CompTIAs survey report feeling optimistic about their role, including 38 who feel very optimistic. Positive sentiments are correlated with company size 71 of IT pros feel optimistic at at small companies less than 100 employees, compared to 83 at both midsized firms 100499 employees and large enterprises more than 500 employees. In addition, nearly half of all respondents at large enterprises report feeling very optimistic about their role. A likely explanation for higher optimism at bigger companies is the wider range of opportunities. Given the historic view of IT as a supporting function and the daily pressures that most companies face, it is no surprise to see that the top focus for most IT pros is tactical. Servers still need to be available and help desk tickets still need to be answered. Beyond this traditional role, though, there are more strategic areas for IT pros to explore, including skill assessment across the organization, improving the cultural mindset around technology and leading discussions across departments regarding technology adoption or future trends. The profusion of opportunity is not just something organizations are doing to help their IT employees. With technology now acting as a critical component in business strategy, it is in a companys best interest to integrate their IT specialists more deeply into operations. Of course, with most organizations making this move, the demand for skills is outpacing available supply, meaning that opportunities are open not only within an IT pros current employer but also in other firms that may provide higher pay or better flexibility. Over the past year, technology job postings have been plentiful and tech unemployment has been incredibly low. There is no reason to expect a huge change to the situation in 2023. This highdemand environment is commonplace today, but it is a relatively new phenomenon for IT professionals. In the early days of enterprise technology, technical skill was not needed by most organizations. Computing was reserved for the largest companies with the biggest budgets. As technology became more widespread, the IT function was largely viewed as a cost center, and IT pros were often constrained in both resources and career progression. In todays environment, companies are viewing IT through a strategic lens and increasing both their appetite for technology and their investment. This then leads to a high demand for skills creating a broad range of career options, which is the top reason for optimism by a wide margin. As described in the trends section, the abundance of choice opens a new set of questions. This is true for IT pros as much as it is true for companies procuring technology products and services. With many options for career advancement, there are also many options for building skills. The top choice for many technologists is to develop skill within their current area of specialization. Beyond that, durable skills such as communications or teamwork are beneficial as technology becomes more of a team sport. Rounding out the top three focus areas, IT pros may choose to explore a new area as businesses explore topics like data science or zero trust architecture. Many new job openings require a mix of various skills, and technical specialists in one field may only need to add a few new skills to become fluent in another discipline. Whether the choice is developing skill within a current specialization or exploring a new opportunity, there is no shortage of skills needed in digital organizations. The many different facets of enterprise technology can be captured in four broad categories. CompTIAs IT framework defines infrastructure, software development, cybersecurity and data managementanalysis as the pillars supporting IT operations. At this high level, the top priorities for the coming year are software development and data managementanalysis. This fits with a viewpoint of companies tailoring technology as it becomes more strategic, but that does not minimize the importance of infrastructure and cybersecurity as foundational pieces of digital transformation. In the area of infrastructure, priorities remain fairly consistent with last years agenda. The ongoing maturity of cloud operations will drive demands in the areas of networking, storage and server administration. As cloud orchestration becomes more important, there will be stronger desire for more advanced skills in each of these fields. Mobile device management takes a step backward this year as there is likely less focus on equipping the workforce, and infrastructure as code IaC makes an initial appearance as organizations place more emphasis on softwaredefined data center operations. The domain of software development is also not experiencing drastic yearoveryear change. As organizations expand the number of customized applications for both internal and external use, there is still a high focus on quality assurance QA and user experience UX. With mobile devices steadily accounting for half of all internet traffic, optimizing digital experiences for mobile consumption continues to be important. IT pros are predicting less focus on DevOps in 2023, but this is largely because DevOps practices have now become firmly established within many firms, driving a constant demand for skill but not new investment or restructuring. Lowcodenocode solutions and containerization expand the reach of software and create more abstraction in the development process, and those areas are both expected to grow in importance in coming years. The fields of cybersecurity and data managementanalysis are newer specializations for many companies, so there is more churn when it comes to focus areas. In cybersecurity, the acknowledgement of a shift away from a secure perimeter into a more granular approach is finally becoming widespread and causing policy change and upskilling need. Data security and application security were new options in this years survey and clearly demonstrate how companies are reimagining their cybersecurity posture. Aside from these two new areas, focus seems to be dropping across the board for cybersecurity topics. This disconnect was explored in depth in CompTIAs 2022 State of Cybersecurity report, and it signals that companies should put more emphasis on integrating cybersecurity with organizational objectives. One specific area to keep an eye on is risk analysis. As businesses try to determine the proper level of investment for cybersecurity initiatives, risk analysis will likely be the framework guiding decisions. Along the same lines, zero trust is not currently a defined approach for many organizations, but elements of a zero trust architecture are seeing more and more adoption. Integration is also a new concern in the area of data managementanalysis. While many companies still need to focus on fundamental database administration in order to create a foundation for advanced data activities, data integration is becoming the overarching process that defines how data will be combined from various sources and made available for consumption and analysis. Analytics and eventually data science is still the end goal, but bringing the data into a comprehensive starting point is still a major challenge. Distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain, is slowly making inroads as an enabling technology, and it may be some time yet before the technology moves from isolated applications to broad usage within data structures. While intent to hire is still strong 44 of companies expect to hire for technical skills in 2023, internal training remains the dominant option for closing skill gaps 64 of companies expect to train existing employees in 2023. In considering workforce development options for the next 12 months, companies may need to invest more heavily in certain components. A rigorous skill assessment can pinpoint the specific skills needed to advance corporate objectives, and it can also define training options that can target those skills. Getting closer to the actual training program, businesses can expand the types of offerings that are provided or subsidized in order to ensure the best pathways for individual learning styles. These investments for workforce development are obviously part of the larger technology budget, which appears to be stabilizing at adequate levels for most companies. As expected, the perception of technology budgets skews toward the insufficient end of the scale. Overall, though, the technology budget is healthy for most organizations, and it is moving in the right direction 43 of companies believe that their technology budget in 2023 will be higher than it was in 2022. At first glance, it may seem strange that any IT professionals would believe that the technology budget is too high. While there are only a small number of individuals in this category, it is worth exploring the sentiment. Given that this viewpoint is slightly more prevalent in larger firms, this may be a statement on balance. In an environment where digital transformation is held up as a new business imperative, organizations may begin viewing technology as a cureall, opening the wallet for advanced technology purchases without making corresponding investments in best practices for usage or restructuring of business flow. This may be exacerbated by business units making their own technology investments. When asked to consider how the overall technology budget was divided between the IT function and business units, IT professionals in CompTIAs survey reported a nearly even split, with a slight lean toward business units. Technology procurement by business units is not necessarily a problem and also not exactly something that can be avoided, but it does require close collaboration. A particular business function may be closest to the situation and best able to define functional requirements, but areas such as cybersecurity and integration likely fall outside the technical expertise of business unit employees. One of the most useful questions for ranking technical priorities might be the consideration of how to spend additional money if new funds became available. This leaves the field openended rather than focusing on an individual topic, and it still provides some degree of constraint given the financial context. Case in point: Automation ranks relatively low in this scenario, whereas most organizations give automation high marks when automation is the only topic of discussion. The tier above automation and collaboration tools contains a mixture of wish list items. There are fairly traditional topics like web presence and cybersecurity alongside a newer topic in data analytics. The desire for new headcount shows up here, even as skill gaps are similar to automation as a topofmind issue in a vacuum. With these items so tightly clustered, the exact priority will depend on the specific needs of an organization. Moving to the top tier, it is somewhat surprising to see endpoints ranked so highly. Given the large investments made to enable a remote workforce over the past two years, one might assume endpoints are up to date. This high priority speaks to the critical need of keeping the workforce productive. Minor glitches with laptops or smartphones can lead to major disruptions in employee productivity. It is no surprise, though, to see innovation in the top slot. Whether it is investing in new products, bringing in thirdparty expertise or creating platforms for technology evaluation, IT professionals believe that accelerating the approach to technology will be the biggest differentiator for their organizations. Daytoday maintenance and improvements are needed for operational progress, but the cutting edge is where potential is fully unlocked. THE BUSINESS OF TECHNOLOGY: FORGING AHEAD IN TOUGH WATERS Much like IT professionals, companies in the business of technology aka the channel are starting to think bigger again, rekindling some of the strategic initiatives and aspirations that may have been put on the back burner during the extended pandemic. Yet there is trepidation as well, with many channel firms of all stripes worried about continued inflation, supply chain issues and the omnipresent threat of an economic recession. Its a paradoxical time as we look ahead to 2023, one in which companies are at once ready to forge ahead with new investments and innovations yet must do so with a dose of caution attributable to the uncertainty of the business landscape. This dilemma is reflected in general attitudes about the year ahead. For the most part, channel firms remain positive about their own companys outlook for 2023, although the numbers have dipped from last year. Sixtyseven percent of respondents said they are feeling either very good or pretty good about 2023 compared with 77 that said the same last year about 2022. Instead, more channel firms have adopted a mixed attitude about how their company will fare in 2023. Twentyfour percent said they are on the fence about how 2023 will go vs. 19 that said the same last year. This sentiment reflects the guessing game situation many companies find themselves in today as they weigh new investments and hiring against continued inflation and a potential recession. Breaking things down a bit more, channel respondents save their most pessimistic attitudes for the current state of the overall economy, compared with the IT industry and their own businesses. While 9 rate the overall economy as \\\"terrible,\\\" the lowest score of 1 on a 110 rating scale, just 2.6 confer that dispiriting take on the IT industry and only 1 on their own businesses. Theres a disconnect, for sure, but one that makes sense based on three years of a pandemic in which other parts of the economy suffered greatly while the tech sector held its own and, in fact, thrived in many areas. Responses from the most positive end of that 110 rating scale bear this reality out: While 8.6 of respondents gave the overall economy a \\\"best\\\" or 10 rating, 12 did so for the IT industry and 15 for their own businesses. Its important to note that these numbers reflect the two extreme ends of the scale bad and good, while most respondents fall in the middle in their assessments of all three areas of the economy. One of the markers that channel firms will be looking for in the year ahead is growth potential of their own business in relation to the tech industry at large. Many are bullish that growth potential is strong. Fortyfive percent of respondents said they expect their own revenue and profitability numbers in 2023 to exceed those of 2022 if the tech sector flourishes. A more cautious 44 of respondents said they expect stable results on par with the year previous, even if the tech sector does well. And finally, roughly 8 said they still expect a decline in revenue and profitability even if the tech industry performs on the positive side of the economic equation. Those predictions are correlated across all company sizes, from the smallest channel firm fewer than 10 employees to those with more than 500 staffers. Hedging ones bets is normal behavior in an uncertain economy, but the reality is that the tech industry and the businesses that operate in it have opportunity galore in the year ahead. Its a matter of unlocking that potential wisely. A few truths to consider: The industry itself is more complex and changing rapidly at both the technology and business levels. From the channels vantage point, that means their expertise will be in demand and greatly valued. The tech portfolio has changed immensely, too. What was once a stable set of infrastructure products on a resellers line card has, in the cloud age, morphed into a cornucopia of softwareasaservice applications, data and cybersecurity tools, and a stack of emerging technologies to contend with. At a business model level, everythings in flux as companies transition into various forms of service provider, referral or influencer agent, consultant or combination of all. Finally, one of the most consequential developments affecting the channel today is the changing customer, specifically their procurement habits and technology preferences. So, what are some of the keys to unlocking that growth and potential? Respondents cite many factors that will help lead to an optimistic performance in 2023. Leading that list is the ability to drum up business from new customers. Nearly 4 in 10 respondents said this will be critical to solid performance in the year ahead. This signals a change in emphasis from the early pandemic years when companies focus was on retaining and expanding business with existing customers. That pursuit is still a prominent aim 28 cited it, but more attention is being placed on building the pipeline this year. Along those lines, the third activity respondents identified as helping to drive positive results next year is tied to making improvements to and investing in both their sales and marketing functions. Perhaps reflecting the need to balance aggressive activities like new customer acquisition and marketing overhauls with cost containment, the no. 2 area that channel firms believe will be needed to contribute to a more optimistic outcome next year is to improve internal operations. In other words, get more efficient. Whether that is streamlining internal processes something critical to a wellrun managed services firm, for example or deploying new automation technologies, the quest for operational efficiency is an ongoing component of optimal business performance. Rounding out the list of items companies deem essential to a positive 2023 include the successful launching of new business lines and a return to normal economic conditions that sees inflation decrease and supply chain woes abate. One could argue that these two factors are interdependent, given that a rough macroeconomy might be considered a poor environment for new business ventures. But that isnt always the case. An attribute of many firms that weather a general economic storm well is their propensity to double down on investments in new things. And a new business line does not necessarily mean new products to sell though it can. It could reflect a shift to a different business model, which will be discussed later in this report. As discussed in the 2023 trends outlined in this report, inflation looms large for the channel. Among the factors that could lead to a pessimistic year ahead, continued high inflation, cited by 41 of respondents, led the pack. The remainder of the list includes 34 that cite concerns over growing labor costs and the need to find workers with the right set of skills for todays tech world, 32 that worry about any unexpected geopolitical or macroeconomic shock to the system, and 30 that fret about customers postponing technology purchases. The causeandeffect element of these concerns is undeniable. Increased inflation or other economic shock could beget recession, which could in turn result in layoffs that upend the labor market and curtail customer spending. Or the reverse could happen. So far, its been unpredictable. One point of interest from the list of factors that arouse pessimism is the relatively low ranking of automation as a hurdle. Just 18 cite automation as a potential threat to growth in the year ahead. As elaborated in one of this reports trends, its clear that automation is a development that is more positive than negative. With some caveats, of course. Lets talk about budgets. Much like general sentiment about prospects for the year ahead, many channel firms are making positive, yet cautious, predictions about their upcoming budgets. Compared to last year when 53 of respondents said budgets would be higher either much or somewhat in the year ahead 2022, a slightly lower 46 said so this year. And whether indicative of caution, pragmatism or both, 38 of this years respondents expect budgets to come in flat, or about the same as the year before. This compares with 26 that predicted this last year. Clearly, the economys uncertainty factor weighs on prognostication here, but fewer firms than last year are expecting decreases to their budget 13 vs 16, respectively. Thinking about what they are currently spending in various functional areas of their business, most respondents are relatively content with the amount. Roughly half of respondents said spending is \\\"about right\\\" for sales, marketing, operations, finance and IT at their companies. If pressed to identify areas where spending is too low, a slight edge goes to sales, marketing and IT functions. Sales and marketing, as indicated above in this report, are considered areas to spend in 2023 to ensure growth and profitability. For many channel firms, marketing has lagged in both resource allocations and general attention. Few channel firms employ a fulltime marketing staffer and the discipline itself has often been overlooked, but on the bright side, data of the last several years shows a more concerted effort around marketing and branding. Baby steps. Interestingly, between 21 and 27 of respondents believe spending is either slightly too high or much too high across all five functional buckets. Given that respondents to the survey come from all disciplines within an organization from the business side of sales, finance and marketing to technical employees to managers and business owners this parity of agreement is somewhat novel. Again, the unifying driver may be economic uncertainty as we enter 2023. Every job role within an organization might be looking for ways to save money, reduce costs, etc. All that said, channel firms have their spending priorities for the year ahead. Some of them reflect strategic external initiatives, others the fuel for operational improvements on the inside. Call this the yin and yang that comprise a highperforming company. Topping the list is updating and modernizing current infrastructure, which 35 of respondents identified as a spending priority. This is an interesting one given that infrastructure improvements have been a focus area throughout the span of the pandemic, when many companies throttled back on new endeavors and instead spent time and money shoring up their own operations, as well as refreshing the basics for their customers. Clearly, that mission is not complete. On par with infrastructure improvements in terms of spending priorities is hiring staff with the right technical skills for todays digital world, which 34 of respondents cited, as well as adding new product and service lines of business, which 34 identified. The workforce issue is perennial, but critically important. As companies jockey against competition, they will need to up their game by hiring employees skilled in job roles in demand, such as those in data, cybersecurity and emerging trends. Software acumen, specifically development skills, will also play a larger role in the channels typical talent needs in 2023. Spending priorities arent just centered on the technical workforce, though. Thirtyone percent of channel firms said they will spend to seek skilled sales and marketing employees in the next year. This would include sales reps that are adept at selling services and consulting contracts, along with marketing professionals with expertise in social media and other omnichannel approaches to customer communications. Speaking of customers, understanding their needs, spending priorities and constraints is a crucial ingredient for channel success in the new year. For years now, the industry has seen a slow but steady shift in who holds the purse strings when it comes to technology decisionmaking and procurement. More and more line of business executives today own tech budget and routinely make critical purchasing decisions for their departments and staff both with and without the involvement of an internal IT department. This has necessitated change within channel firms seeking to work with these customers, especially with respect to sales techniques and activities, as well as marketing messaging and the choice of conduits for communication. Channel firms rely on some approximation of what customer budgets for technology look like each year. Its been a crapshoot of forecasting for many firms during the pandemic, especially those that count the small end of the SMB market as their primary customers. Those SMBs were hard hit during the pandemic and their tech spending in many cases dropped off. Still, patterns were unpredictable. For some customers, the unforeseen remote work migration forced a wave of spending on devices, WiFi and other virtual communications apps. Still others turned to the services of an MSP for the first time ever. Diving into the data, channel respondent predictions for customer spending on technology in 2023 mirrors nearly exactly what they saw for real in 2022. Thats a safe assessment on their part, again likely reflecting the economic unknowns ahead. Depending on how things go with inflation and other economic variables, customer spending on technology could surge past or retreat from these predictions. What is completely clear is that everyone today is a potential customer of technology. Consider the following: 17 of channel firms said they sell to a business ownerpresident, 26 sell to business executives, 31 sell to an IT department person and 26 sell to all three. This means the days of speeds and feeds tech talk as the main sales call vernacular to the IT guy are largely over. Buyers today want a channel provider that has unique knowledge of their business mission, operational needs and goals. The shift in conversation toward business outcomes is a learning curve for many channel firms, but the skill will be essential moving forward as part of overall improvements to customer experience and sales effectiveness. Business models are changing for the channel just as the customer is. For years, we have been hearing about and witnessing a slow march from traditional reseller of hardware to fullportfolio solution provider to managed services provider. That is very much still happening. But the drumbeat for business model change seems louder today, largely driven by a digitaleverything economy, cloud computing, hardware commoditization and margin erosion, and direct procurement competition from online marketplaces and vendors. Business model change can mean many different things to many different channel firms. A small tweak such as adding a vertical specialty, for example. Or a major transition from a product reseller to a company that does pure IT consulting. Whatever it happens to be, most channel firms today report some degree of business model change or active consideration of starting one. Twenty percent of respondents said they have already undergone a change to their business model in the last few years 35 are in the middle of one and 32 are currently exploring one but have not yet started. Just 11 said that no business model talks are on the table at this time. Larger firms are ahead of their smaller brethren in terms of completed business model shifts, not surprising given their access to greater financial resources and the ability to pilot project new initiatives while keeping their original business going. Small firms typically just cant do that. That said, a net 68 of micro and smallsized channel respondents said they were currently undergoing a business model transition. What do these business model changes look like? For the most part, they are variations on a theme: The move to recurring revenue and services. But the flavors are nuanced. Here are the top five business model shifts respondents reported: Product reseller to MSP selling everything from infrastructure to business applications to emtech services Transition to a combination of different business models Product reseller to traditional MSP selling infrastructure services devicesnetwork Product reseller to cloud services provider managing SaaS and other cloudbased workloads for clients Transition to an IT referral or consulting business This journey to recurring revenue and, most importantly, services has been ongoing. But todays realities have elevated the urgency of moving faster. More customers buying directly from online marketplaces has many in the channel scurrying to find their competitive play when they no longer own the initial transaction. That play takes the form of pre and postsales services, including work around integration, cybersecurity, compliance and ongoing management of the customer environment. And lets not forget the financial piece of the picture. Services are lucrative, certainly more profitable than hardware sales today. They also bond channel firms to their customers, whether through ongoing project work or managed services. This customer stickiness and familiarity has been one of the channels greatest assets over the years. Its also one that holds up during the ebbs and flows of an uncertain economy. METHODOLOGY This quantitative study consisted of two online surveys fielded to business and IT professionals during SeptemberOctober 2022. A total of 500 professionals based in the United States participated in each survey, yielding an overall margin of sampling error at 95 confidence of 4.5 percentage points. For international regions ANZ, ASEAN, Benelux, DACH and UK, a total of 125 professionals in each region participated in each survey, yielding an overall margin of sampling error at 95 confidence of 8.9. Sampling error is larger for subgroups of the data. As with any survey, sampling error is only one source of possible error. While nonsampling error cannot be accurately calculated, precautionary steps were taken in all phases of the survey design, collection and processing of the data to minimize its influence.

NASDAQ: GOOGL As Sergey and I wrote in the original founders letter 11 years ago, \\\"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\\\" As part of that, we also said that you could expect us to make \\\"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.\\\" From the start, weve always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have. We did a lot of things that seemed crazy at the time. Many of those crazy things now have over a billion users, like Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and Android. And we havent stopped there. We are still trying to do things other people think are crazy but we are super excited about. Weve long believed that over time companies tend to get comfortable doing the same thing, just making incremental changes. But in the technology industry, where revolutionary ideas drive the next big growth areas, you need to be a bit uncomfortable to stay relevant. Our company is operating well today, but we think we can make it cleaner and more accountable. So we are creating a new company, called Alphabet. I am really excited to be running Alphabet as CEO with help from my capable partner, Sergey, as President. What is Alphabet? Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies. The largest of which, of course, is Google. This newer Google is a bit slimmed down, with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products contained in Alphabet instead. What do we mean by far afield? Good examples are our health efforts: Life Sciences that works on the glucosesensing contact lens, and Calico focused on longevity. Fundamentally, we believe this allows us more management scale, as we can run things independently that arent very related. Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence. In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business, with Sergey and me in service to them as needed. We will rigorously handle capital allocation and work to make sure each business is executing well. Well also make sure we have a great CEO for each business, and well determine their compensation. In addition, with this new structure we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results, where Google financials will be provided separately than those for the rest of Alphabet businesses as a whole. This new structure will allow us to keep tremendous focus on the extraordinary opportunities we have inside of Google. A key part of this is Sundar Pichai. Sundar has been saying the things I would have said and sometimes better! for quite some time now, and Ive been tremendously enjoying our work together. He has really stepped up since October of last year, when he took on product and engineering responsibility for our internet businesses. Sergey and I have been super excited about his progress and dedication to the company. And it is clear to us and our board that it is time for Sundar to be CEO of Google. I feel very fortunate to have someone as talented as he is to run the slightly slimmed down Google and this frees up time for me to continue to scale our aspirations. I have been spending quite a bit of time with Sundar, helping him and the company in any way I can, and I will of course continue to do that. Google itself is also making all sorts of new products, and I know Sundar will always be focused on innovationcontinuing to stretch boundaries. I know he deeply cares that we can continue to make big strides on our core mission to organize the worlds information. Recent launches like Google Photos and Google Now using machine learning are amazing progress. Google also has some services that are run with their own identity, like YouTube. Susan is doing a great job as CEO, running a strong brand and driving incredible growth. Sergey and I are seriously in the business of starting new things. Alphabet will also include our X lab, which incubates new efforts like Wing, our drone delivery effort . We are also stoked about growing our investment arms, Ventures and Capital, as part of this new structure. Alphabet Inc. will replace Google Inc. as the publiclytraded entity and all shares of Google will automatically convert into the same number of shares of Alphabet, with all of the same rights. Google will become a whollyowned subsidiary of Alphabet. Our two classes of shares will continue to trade on Nasdaq as GOOGL and GOOG. For Sergey and me this is a very exciting new chapter in the life of Googlethe birth of Alphabet. We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanitys most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search! We also like that it means alphabet Alpha is investment return above benchmark, which we strive for! I should add that we are not intending for this to be a big consumer brand with related productsthe whole point is that Alphabet companies should have independence and develop their own brands. We are excited about Getting more ambitious things done. Taking the longterm view. Empowering great entrepreneurs and companies to flourish. Investing at the scale of the opportunities and resources we see. Improving the transparency and oversight of what were doing. Making Google even better through greater focus. And hopefully as a result of all this, improving the lives of as many people as we can. What could be better? No wonder we are excited to get to work with everyone in the Alphabet family. Dont worry, were still getting used to the name too! https:abc.xyz 222023 Alphabet Announces Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Results MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. February 2, 2023 Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL today announced financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.

NonGAAP Financial Measures The nonGAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and nonGAAP financial data is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release. Broadcom believes nonGAAP financial information provides additional insight into the Companys ongoing performance. Therefore, Broadcom provides this information to investors for a more consistent basis of comparison and to help them evaluate the results of the Companys ongoing operations and enable more meaningful period to period comparisons. In addition to GAAP reporting, Broadcom provides investors with net income, operating income, gross margin, operating expenses, cash flow and other data on a nonGAAP basis. This nonGAAP information excludes amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets, stockbased compensation expense, restructuring, impairment and disposal charges, acquisitionrelated costs, including integration costs, purchase accounting effect on inventory, litigation settlements, loss on debt extinguishment, gains losses on investments, income loss from discontinued operations, nonGAAP tax reconciling adjustments, and other adjustments. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of the Companys underlying performance. Internally, these nonGAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating the core operating performance of the Company, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to the Companys operations, and benchmarking performance externally against the Companys competitors. The exclusion of these and other similar items from Broadcoms nonGAAP financial results should not be interpreted as implying that these items are nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual. Free cash flow measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Investors should not consider presentation of free cash flow measures as implying that stockholders have any right to such cash. Broadcoms free cash flow may not be calculated in a manner comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. About Broadcom Inc. Broadcom Inc. NASDAQ: AVGO, a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Jose, CA, is a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. Broadcoms categoryleading product portfolio serves critical markets including data center, networking, enterprise software, broadband, wireless, storage and industrial.

Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures In this news release, the company supplements its reporting of information determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles \\\"GAAP\\\", such as revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Fiserv, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, with \\\"adjusted revenue,\\\" \\\"adjusted revenue growth,\\\" \\\"organic revenue,\\\" \\\"organic revenue growth,\\\" \\\"adjusted operating income,\\\" \\\"adjusted operating margin,\\\" \\\"adjusted net income,\\\" \\\"adjusted earnings per share,\\\" \\\"adjusted earnings per share growth,\\\" and \\\"free cash flow.\\\" Management believes that adjustments for certain noncash or other items and the exclusion of certain passthrough revenue and expenses should enhance shareholders ability to evaluate the companys performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Therefore, the company excludes these items from its GAAP financial measures to calculate these unaudited nonGAAP measures. The corresponding reconciliations of these unaudited nonGAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this news release, except for forwardlooking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the noncash and other items described below that are excluded from the nonGAAP outlook measures. See page 15 for additional information regarding the companys forwardlooking nonGAAP financial measures. Examples of noncash or other items may include, but are not limited to, noncash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions noncash impairment charges severance costs net charges associated with debt financing activities merger and integration costs gains or losses from the sale of businesses, certain assets or investments certain discrete tax benefits and expenses and noncash deferred revenue adjustments relating to the 2019 acquisition of First Data Corporation. The company excludes these items to more clearly focus on the factors management believes are pertinent to the companys operations, and management uses this information to make operating decisions, including the allocation of resources to the companys various businesses. The company adjusts its nonGAAP results to exclude amortization of acquisitionrelated intangible assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing andor size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of acquisitionrelated intangible asset amortization supplements GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability of operating performance. Although the company excludes amortization from acquisitionrelated intangible assets from its nonGAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Management believes organic revenue growth is useful because it presents adjusted revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions, dispositions and the companys Output Solutions postage reimbursements and including deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments. Management believes free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions. Management believes this supplemental information enhances shareholders ability to evaluate and understand the companys core business performance. These unaudited nonGAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Fiserv, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP.

As a result, the company modified its segment reporting in the first quarter of 2022 to align to the previously announced business reorganization. All priorperiod segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way the company internally manages and monitors operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2022.

These nonGAAP financial measures include nonGAAP operating income loss, nonGAAP net income loss, and nonGAAP net income loss per share. NonGAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These nonGAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from nonGAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. We compute nonGAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year. We may consider whether other significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our nonGAAP financial measures. We exclude the following items from all of our nonGAAP financial measures: Sharebased compensation expense Amortization of acquired technology Amortization of other acquired intangible assets Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges Gains and losses on disposals of businesses and longlived assets Professional fees and transaction costs for business combinations We also exclude the following items from nonGAAP net income loss and diluted net income loss per share: Gains and losses on debt and equity securities and other investments Income tax effects and adjustments Discontinued operations We believe these nonGAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding Intuits operating results primarily because they exclude amounts that we do not consider part of ongoing operating results when planning and forecasting and when assessing the performance of the organization, our individual operating segments, or our senior management. Segment managers are not held accountable for sharebased compensation expense, amortization, or the other excluded items and, accordingly, we exclude these amounts from our measures of segment performance. We believe our nonGAAP financial measures also facilitate the comparison by management and investors of results for current periods and guidance for future periods with results for past periods. The following are descriptions of the items we exclude from our nonGAAP financial measures. Sharebased compensation expenses. These consist of noncash expenses for stock options, restricted stock units, and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. When considering the impact of equity awards, we place greater emphasis on overall shareholder dilution rather than the accounting charges associated with those awards. Amortization of acquired technology and amortization of other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire a business in a business combination, we are required by GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the business and amortize them over their useful lives. Amortization of acquired technology in cost of revenue includes amortization of software and other technology assets of acquired businesses. Amortization of other acquired intangible assets in operating expenses includes amortization of assets such as customer lists, covenants not to compete, and trade names. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. We exclude from our nonGAAP financial measures noncash charges to adjust the carrying values of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets to their estimated fair values. Gains and losses on disposals of businesses and longlived assets. We exclude from our nonGAAP financial measures gains and losses on disposals of businesses and longlived assets because they are unrelated to our ongoing business operating results. Professional fees and transaction costs for business combinations. We exclude from our nonGAAP financial measures the professional fees we incur to complete business combinations. These include investment banking, legal, and accounting fees. Gains and losses on debt securities and other investments. We exclude from our nonGAAP financial measures credit losses on availableforsale debt securities and gains and losses on other investments. Income tax effects and adjustments. We use a longterm nonGAAP tax rate for evaluating operating results and for planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. This longterm nonGAAP tax rate excludes the income tax effects of the nonGAAP pretax adjustments described above, and eliminates the effects of nonrecurring and period specific items which can vary in size and frequency. Based on our current longterm projections, we are using a longterm nonGAAP tax rate of 24 for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. This longterm nonGAAP tax rate could be subject to change for various reasons including significant acquisitions, changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. We will evaluate this longterm nonGAAP tax rate on an annual basis and whenever any significant events occur which may materially affect this rate. Operating results and gains and losses on the sale of discontinued operations. From time to time, we sell or otherwise dispose of selected operations as we adjust our portfolio of businesses to meet our strategic goals. In accordance with GAAP, we segregate the operating results of discontinued operations as well as gains and losses on the sale of these discontinued operations from continuing operations on our GAAP statements of operations but continue to include them in GAAP net income or loss and net income or loss per share. We exclude these amounts from our nonGAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of the forwardlooking nonGAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in Table E include all information reasonably available to Intuit at the date of this press release. These tables include adjustments that we can reasonably predict. Events that could cause the reconciliation to change include acquisitions and divestitures of businesses, goodwill and other asset impairments, sales of availableforsale debt securities and other investments, and disposals of business and longlived assets.

Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was positively impacted by new customer acquisitions and growing customer spend in our Multicloud Services and Apps Cross Platform segments. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 3 in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Revenue from our Core Segments \\\"Core Revenue\\\", comprised of Multicloud Services and Apps Cross Platform, increased 2 on an actual basis and 4 on a constant currency basis, in the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2022 we recorded 217 million of noncash impairment charges driven primarily by 129 million of goodwill and a 75 million asset impairment. The goodwill impairment was in our Apps Cross Platform segment and was driven primarily by the decline in market capitalization following the ransomware attack on our Hosted Exchange email business. The asset impairment was for our San Antonio headquarters office as we prepare for our relocation to North San Antonio later in 2023. Loss from operations was 227 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to loss from operations of 27 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Net loss was 214 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to net loss of 83 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Net loss per diluted share was 1.01 in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to net loss per diluted share of 0.39 in the fourth quarter of 2021. NonGAAP Operating Profit was 74 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 40 compared to 122 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. NonGAAP Earnings Per Share was 0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of 76 as compared to NonGAAP Earnings Per Share of 0.25 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Capital expenditures were 43 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 27 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Full Year 2022 Results Revenue was 3,122 million in 2022, an increase of 4 as compared to revenue of 3,010 million in 2021. Revenue for full year 2022 was positively impacted by new customer acquisitions and growing customer spend in our Multicloud Services and Apps Cross Platform segments. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 5 in 2022 compared to 2021. Core Revenue increased 5 on an actual basis and 7 on a constant currency basis, in 2022 as compared to 2021. Impairment of goodwill and impairment of assets were 535 million and 146 million, respectively, in 2022. These impairments reflect a sustained decrease in our market capitalization and lowered projected operating results primarily due to product mix shifts, impacts from the December ransomware incident, and market concerns related to inflation, supply chain disruption issues and other macroeconomic factors. We also recorded an impairment of 75 million for our San Antonio headquarters office as we prepare for our relocation to North San Antonio in 2023. Loss from operations was 679 million in 2022, compared to loss from operations of 3 million in 2021. Net loss was 805 million in 2022, compared to net loss of 218 million in 2021.

NonGAAP Earnings Per Share was 0.54 in 2022, a decrease of 44 as compared to NonGAAP Earnings Per Share of 0.97 in 2021. Capital expenditures were 142 million in 2022, compared to 203 million in 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of 241 million with no balance outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. Financial Outlook Rackspace Technology is providing guidance as follows: 1 NonGAAP Other Income Expense is only expected to include interest expense. Definitions of nonGAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the most directly comparable measures in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States \\\"GAAP\\\" are provided in subsequent sections of this press release narrative and supplemental schedules. Rackspace Technology has not reconciled NonGAAP Operating Profit, NonGAAP Loss Per Share, NonGAAP Other Income Expense or NonGAAP Tax Expense Rate guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because it does not provide guidance on GAAP net income loss or the reconciling items between these NonGAAP measures and GAAP net income loss as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, certain of these items, such as sharebased compensation expense. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the nonGAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort. With respect to NonGAAP Operating Profit, NonGAAP Loss Per Share, NonGAAP Other Income Expense and NonGAAP Tax Expense Rate guidance, adjustments in future periods are generally expected to be similar to the kinds of charges and costs excluded from these NonGAAP measures in prior periods, but the impact of such adjustments could be significant. Conference Call and Webcast Rackspace Technology will hold a conference call today, February 22, 2023, at 4:00pm CT 5:00pm ET to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2022 results.

NonGAAP Financial Measures This press release includes several nonGAAP financial measures such as constant currency revenue, NonGAAP Gross Profit, NonGAAP Net Income Loss, NonGAAP Operating Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and NonGAAP Earnings Per Share \\\"EPS\\\". These nonGAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain costs, losses and gains that are required to be included in our profit and loss measures under GAAP. Although we believe these measures are useful to investors and analysts for the same reasons they are useful to management, as described in the accompanying pages, these measures are not a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP financial measures or disclosures. Other companies may calculate similarlytitled nonGAAP measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We have reconciled each of these nonGAAP measures to the applicable most comparable GAAP measure in the accompanying pages.

NonGAAP Net Income Loss, NonGAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA We present NonGAAP Net Income Loss, NonGAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA because they are a basis upon which management assesses our performance and we believe they are useful to evaluating our financial performance. We believe that excluding items from net income that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and that may vary in frequency or magnitude, enhances the comparability of our results and provides a better baseline for analyzing trends in our business. We define NonGAAP Net Income Loss as net income loss adjusted to exclude the impact of noncash charges for sharebased compensation, special bonuses and other compensation expense, transactionrelated costs and adjustments, restructuring and transformation charges, costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and certain other nonoperating, nonrecurring or noncore gains and losses, as well as the tax effects of these nonGAAP adjustments. We define NonGAAP Operating Profit as income loss from operations adjusted to exclude the impact of noncash charges for sharebased compensation, special bonuses and other compensation expense, transactionrelated costs and adjustments, restructuring and transformation charges, costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and certain other nonoperating, nonrecurring or noncore gains and losses. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income loss adjusted to exclude the impact of noncash charges for sharebased compensation, special bonuses and other compensation expense, transactionrelated costs and adjustments, restructuring and transformation charges, costs related to the Hosted Exchange incident, certain other nonoperating, nonrecurring or noncore gains and losses, interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. NonGAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are managements principal metrics for measuring our underlying financial performance. NonGAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA, along with other quantitative and qualitative information, are also the principal financial measures used by management and our board of directors in determining performancebased compensation for our management and key employees. These nonGAAP measures are not intended to imply that we would have generated higher income or avoided net losses if the November 2016 merger and the subsequent transactions and initiatives had not occurred. In the future we may incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate NonGAAP Net Income Loss, NonGAAP Operating Profit or Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of NonGAAP Net Income Loss, NonGAAP Operating Profit and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items. Other companies, including our peer companies, may calculate similarlytitled measures in a different manner from us, and therefore, our nonGAAP measures may not be comparable to similarlytiled measures of other companies. Investors are cautioned against using these measures to the exclusion of our results in accordance with GAAP.

Group results at a glance Six months ended June 2023 1 For a breakdown of the individual adjustments see table \\\"NonIFRS Adjustments by Functional Areas\\\" in this Quarterly Statement. 2 From continuing and discontinued operations. Due to rounding, numbers may not add up precisely. Financial Highlights1 Second Quarter 2023 Current cloud backlog grew by 21 to 11.54 billion and was up 25 at constant currencies. SAP S4HANA current cloud backlog was up 65 to 3.72 billion and up 70 at constant currencies. In the second quarter, cloud revenue was up 19 to 3.32 billion and up 22 at constant currencies. SAP S4HANA cloud revenue was up 74 to 823 million and up 79 at constant currencies. Software licenses revenue decreased by 26 to 316 million and was down 24 at constant currencies. Cloud and software revenue was up 5 to 6.50 billion and up 8 at constant currencies. Services revenue was up 4 to 1.05 billion and up 7 at constant currencies. Total revenue was up 5 to 7.55 billion and up 8 at constant currencies. The share of more predictable revenue increased by 2 percentage points to 82 in the second quarter. Supported by the successful completion of the nextgeneration cloud delivery program, cloud gross profit was up 20 IFRS to 2.36 billion, up 20 to 2.40 billion nonIFRS, and up 24 nonIFRS at constant currencies. IFRS operating profit increased 28 to 1.36 billion. NonIFRS operating profit was up 23 to 2.06 billion and up 28 at constant currencies. The increase was mainly driven by cloud revenue growth, finalization of the next generation cloud delivery program, as well as efficiency gains. In addition, operating profit in the second quarter of last year was negatively impacted by SAPs decision to wind down its business operations in Russia and Belarus. Beyond that, Q2 IFRS operating profit growth benefitted from the restructuring expenses we reported in Q2 last year. On the other hand, it was negatively affected by higher sharebased compensation expenses primarily due to the shareprice development over the second quarter of this year. IFRS earnings per share basic increased 15 to 0.62. NonIFRS earnings per share basic increased 12 to 1.07. The effective tax rate was 33.8 IFRS and 30.4 nonIFRS. Free cash flow in the second quarter increased significantly to 604 million, driven by the strong expansion of operating profit and a reduction of payments for, amongst others, sharebased compensation, capex and leasing. For the first six months, free cash flow was up 19 to 2.56 billion. Completion of Qualtrics divestiture On June 28, SAP announced the completion of the sale of its stake in Qualtrics at a price of US18.15 in cash per share. The closing of the transaction contributed an aftertax gain on sale of approximately 3.2 billion IFRS and approximately 2.6 billion NonIFRS to SAPs results. The cash inflow resulting from the purchase price was 7.1 billion 6.4 billion net of cash and cash equivalents held by Qualtrics. All contributions from the Qualtrics divestiture are reflected in results from discontinued operations. For details, please refer to section M in other disclosures on page 30 of this document. Completion of nextgeneration cloud delivery program Early in the second quarter, SAP successfully completed the migration of its cloud customer base to its stateoftheart, harmonized cloud infrastructure.

The proactive actions weve taken to lower costs, manage production output, reduce debt and drive operational leverage have underpinned resilient performance and solid cash generation, while continuing to advance our revolutionary HAMR technology,\\\" said Dave Mosley, Seagates chief executive officer. \\\"Through our actions, Seagate is now leaner, our balance sheet healthier, and our product roadmap even stronger, positioning the company to weather the nearterm business environment, deliver financial leverage, and capture attractive longterm opportunities for Mass Capacity storage.\\\" Quarterly Financial Results Annual Financial Results The Company generated 218 million in cash flow from operations and 168 million in free cash flow during the fiscal fourth quarter 2023. For fiscal year 2023, the Company generated 942 million in cash flow from operations and 626 million in free cash flow. During the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company paid cash dividends of 145 million. For the full year, the Company returned 990 million of capital to shareholders, through the payment of cash dividends of 582 million and in the fiscal first quarter 2023 used 408 million to repurchase 5.4 million ordinary shares. In light of the macroeconomic environment, the Company paused stock repurchases for the reminder of the fiscal year. Additionally, the Company strengthened its balance sheet position by reducing its overall debt by approximately 800 million through debt exchange, retirement and restructuring since fiscal first quarter 2023. As of the end of the fiscal year, cash and cash equivalents totaled 786 million, and there were 207 million ordinary shares issued and outstanding. For a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to nonGAAP results, see accompanying financial tables. Seagate has issued a Supplemental Financial Information document, which is available on Seagates Investor Relations website at investors.seagate.com. Quarterly Cash Dividend The Board of Directors of the Company the \\\"Board\\\" declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.70 per share, which will be payable on October 10, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 26, 2023. The payment of any future quarterly dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon Seagates financial position, results of operations, available cash, cash flow, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Business Outlook The business outlook for the fiscal first quarter 2024 is based on our current assumptions and expectations actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed in the Cautionary Note Regarding ForwardLooking Statements section of this release. The Company is providing the following guidance for its fiscal first quarter 2024: Revenue of 1.55 billion, plus or minus 150 million NonGAAP loss per share of 0.16, plus or minus 0.20 Guidance regarding nonGAAP loss per share excludes known pretax charges related to estimated sharebased compensation expenses of 0.15 per share. We have not reconciled our nonGAAP loss per share guidance for fiscal first quarter 2024 to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, other than estimated sharebased compensation expenses, because material items that may impact these measures are out of our control andor cannot be reasonably predicted, including, but not limited to, accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net gain loss recognized from early redemption of debt, purchase order cancellation fees, strategic investment losses gains or impairment charges, income tax adjustments on these measures, and other charges or benefits that may arise. The amounts of these measures are not currently available but may be material to future results. A reconciliation of the nonGAAP loss per share guidance for fiscal first quarter 2024 to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort. A reconciliation of our historical nonGAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalent is contained in this release.

The information contained in, or that can be accessed through, Seagates websites and social media channels are not part of this press release. Use of nonGAAP financial information The Company uses nonGAAP measures of gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, income from operations, operating margin, net income, diluted EPS, free cash flow, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months adjusted EBITDA, which are adjusted from results based on GAAP to exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses. These nonGAAP financial measures are provided to enhance the users overall understanding of the Companys current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the Company believes nonGAAP results provide useful information to both management and investors as these nonGAAP results exclude certain benefits, expenses, gains and losses that it believes are not indicative of its core operating results and because it is similar to the approach used in connection with the financial models and estimates published by financial analysts who follow the Company. These nonGAAP results are some of the measurements management uses to assess the Companys performance, allocate resources and plan for future periods. Reported nonGAAP results should only be considered as supplemental to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and not considered as a substitute or replacement for, or superior to, GAAP results. These nonGAAP measures may differ from the nonGAAP measures reported by other companies in its industry. The Companys NonGAAP measures are adjusted for the following items: Accelerated depreciation, impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts These expenses are excluded in the nonGAAP measures due to the inconsistency in amount and frequency and are excluded to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Companys current operating performance and comparison to its past periods operating performance. Amortization of acquired intangible assets The Company records expense from amortization of intangible assets that were acquired in connection with its business combinations over their estimated useful lives. Such charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the Companys acquisitions. Consequently, these expenses are excluded in the nonGAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods operating performance. BIS settlement penalty The Company accrued a settlement penalty of 300 million for the fiscal third quarter of 2023 related to the alleged violations of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations between August 17, 2020 and September 29, 2021 by the U.S. Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security \\\"BIS\\\", which were subsequently resolved by a settlement agreement on April 18, 2023. This settlement penalty is excluded from the nonGAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of the Companys current operating performance and comparison to its past periods operating performance. Net loss gain recognized from early redemption of debt From time to time, the Company incurs gains, losses and fees from the early redemption and repurchase of certain longterm debt instruments. The gains and losses represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished less the writeoff of any unamortized debt issuance costs and discount. Fees include certain costs associated with a debt extinguishment or modification. The amount of these charges may be inconsistent in size and varies depending on the timing of the early redemption of debt and consequently is excluded from the nonGAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods operating performance. Pandemicrelated lockdown charges Pandemicrelated lockdown charges are factory underutilization costs incurred due to the pandemicrelated lockdown measures at our factory in Wuxi, China. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the nonGAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods operating performance. Purchase order cancellation fees Purchase order cancellation fees are the costs incurred to cancel certain purchase commitments made with the Companys suppliers for component and equipment purchases that will not be received due to change in forecasted demand. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the nonGAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods operating performance. Restructuring and other, net Restructuring and other, net are costs associated with restructuring plans that are primarily related to costs associated with reduction in the Companys workforce, exiting certain facilities and other related costs, as well as charges or gains from sale of properties. These costs or benefits do not reflect the Companys ongoing operating performance and consequently are excluded from the nonGAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods operating performance. Sharebased compensation These expenses consist primarily of expenses for employee sharebased compensation. Given the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining sharebased compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the Companys control, the Company believes excluding sharebased compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the Companys peers, a majority of whom also exclude sharebased compensation expense from their nonGAAP results. Strategic investment losses or impairment charges From time to time, the Company incurs losses, gains or impairment charges from strategic investments that are measured and accounted at fair value, under the equity method of accounting, as availableforsale debt securities or adjust for downward or upward adjustments to the carrying value under the measurement alternative if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period that are not considered as part of its ongoing operating performance. The resulting expense, gain or impairment loss is inconsistent in amount and frequency and consequently is excluded from the nonGAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods operating performance. Other charges The other charges primarily include IT transformation costs. These charges are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are excluded in the nonGAAP measures to facilitate a more meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance and comparison to its past periods operating performance. Income tax adjustments Provision or benefit for income taxes represents the tax effects of nonGAAP adjustments determined using a hybrid with and without method and effective tax rate for the applicable adjustment and jurisdiction. Free cash flow Free cash flow is a nonGAAP measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. Free cash flow does not reflect noncash items, net cash used or provided by financing activities and net cash used or provided by investing activities, other than acquisition of property, equipment and leasehold improvements. This nonGAAP financial measure is used by management to assess the Companys sources of liquidity, capital structure and operating performance. EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and last twelve months LTM adjusted EBITDA EBITDA is defined as net income loss before income tax expense, interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain expenses, gains and losses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. These adjustments primarily include impairment and other charges related to cost saving efforts, net gain recognized from early redemption of debt, pandemicrelated lockdown charges, purchase order cancellation fees, restructuring and other, net, sharebased compensation, strategic investment losses gains or impairment charges, other extraordinary charges such as factory underutilization charges and BIS settlement penalty. LTM adjusted EBITDA is defined as the total of last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. These nonGAAP financial measures are used by management to evaluate the Companys debt portfolio and structure to comply with its financial debt covenants.

About Key Metrics and NonGAAP Financial Measures This press release contains key metrics and nonGAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G and Item 10e of Regulation SK. Such nonGAAP financial measures are measures of our historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that are adjusted to exclude or include amounts that are excluded or included, as the case may be, from the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS. The table on page 11 provides IT Services Revenue on a constant currency basis, which is a nonGAAP financial measure that is calculated by translating IT Services Revenue from the current reporting period into U.S. dollars based on the currency conversion rate in effect for the prior reporting period. We refer to growth rates in constant currency so that business results may be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating periodtoperiod comparisons of our business performance. Further, in the normal course of business, we may divest a portion of our business which may not be strategic. We refer to the growth rates in both reported and constant currency adjusting for such divestments in order to represent the comparable growth rates. Our key metrics and nonGAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS and may be different from nonGAAP measures used by other companies. Our key metrics and nonGAAP financial measures are not comparable to, nor should be substituted for, an analysis of our revenue over time and involve estimates and judgments. In addition to our nonGAAP measures, the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and the reconciliation of these nonGAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure should be carefully evaluated.

It also requires the partners to gather incident and investigation data, provide monthly feedback on the information and includes quarterly and annual evaluations by the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health (ADOSH).\\nThere are currently about 12,000 workers on the project, and the agreement will apply to all contractors, subcontractors and trades working on the site.\\n\\u201cThis involves everybody because everybody plays an important role, and everybody has an important responsibility,\\u201d Ashley said.\\nThe governor announced the new agreement about a month after reports surfaced of a concerning safety culture on the TSMC worksite. In June, The American Prospect reported on a litany of claims from workers, including allegations that two construction workers died on the site. The report cites a letter Aaron Butler, president of the Arizona Building Trades Council, sent to the White House that references a man that died from blood loss.\\nAnother union representative, Luke Kasper with the sheet metal workers union, told The American Prospect, \\u201cIt\\u2019s easily the most unsafe site I\\u2019ve ever walked on. \\u201d\\nTSMC denied the allegations of deaths on the job site and defended its safety record.\\n\\u201cTSMC is deeply committed to workplace safety.

In July, TSMC Chairman Mark Liu told investors construction at the Phoenix plant was slowed by a lack of skilled workers and production at the facility would be delayed from 2024 to 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal.\\nHobbs noted that the number of registered apprentices in Arizona is already on the rise, increasing by 42% between 2010 and 2021.

Whether your top issue is workforce, or rural jobs  this is the way to do it: Our budget makes historic investments into community colleges to empower our people with a quality education and the skills of the future. \\u201d\\nThrough targeted investments, Governor Ducey is proposing to establish six advanced manufacturing training centers facilitated by community colleges across the state.
